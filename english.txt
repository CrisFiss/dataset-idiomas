$$$Dial back the clock nearly 4 billion years, to a time called the Archean, and the sun would appear about 30% dimmer than it is now. That's a problem: It couldn't have warmed Earth enough to keep the seas from becoming permanent ice sheets. Yet overwhelming geological evidence indicates that liquid w$$$has existed on our planet since the seas formed more than 4 billion years ago, even during the deepest ice ages. What could have provided the added warmth? In 1972, famed astronomer Carl Sagan proposed that the answer lay in the atmosphere. Sagan and his co-author George Mullen hypothesized that car$$$dioxide (CO2) concentrations were much higher during the Archean—possibly 100 times higher than they are today—and therefore the atmosphere could retain enough heat to keep the planet from freezing. But so far, no one has found convincing data that Earth was once a super greenhouse. And now research$$$have uncovered strong evidence to the contrary. A team led by earth scientist Minik Rosing of the University of Copenhagen analyzed iron-bearing rocks in southwestern Greenland that were 3.8 billion years old. They focused on two minerals, magnetite and siderite, that can provide a bellwether of the$$$CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Too much CO2, and magnetite can't form, whereas the opposite is true for siderite. Based on the ratio of the minerals, the team reports in tomorrow's issue of Nature that CO2 levels during the Archean could have been no higher than about 1000 parts per million—a$$$three times the current level of 387 ppm and not high enough to compensate for the weak sun.$The results were "very surprising," Rosing says. As to the question of what kept the planet warm instead of CO2, he says his research points to two possibilities. First, Earth's land masses were much smaller$$$billions of years ago, meaning that the oceans, which generally are darker than continents, could absorb more of the sun's heat. Second, because life was brand new, organisms were manufacturing little of the gases that help clouds form. So, more sunlight reached the surface. There are bound to be ot$$$factors, Rosing says. "I think that our paper is just one link in a long chain of further refinements of our understanding of the early Earth and of the dynamics of our planet."$Earth scientist James Kasting of Pennsylvania State University, University Park, thinks it's premature to discard the gree$$$option. Temperatures during the Archean were at least as high as they are today, despite the weaker sun, he says. It's difficult to account for the warmth using just the mechanisms suggested in this paper, Kasting says. "So, I think there is still a need for additional greenhouse gases." Zebrafish h$$$can take a licking and keep on ticking. Even if they lose up to 20% of a ventricle, the animals form a clot that stops bleeding within seconds and then gradually replace the lost tissue. Within a month or so, they are back to normal. The impressive repair work is accomplished not by stem cells in th$$$heart but by mature heart cells, two new studies suggest. Figuring out exactly how the animals accomplish their self-repair could help scientists find ways to trigger similar regeneration in human patients. A long-standing question for scientists who study zebrafish, salamanders, and other animals t$$$can regrow lost parts is whether the animals activate and recruit stem cells to make the repair or whether they trigger their mature cells to start dividing again, says Elly Tanaka, a developmental biologist at the Center for Regenerative Therapies at the University of Technology Dresden in Germany.$$$The new papers clearly show that for zebrafish hearts, mature cells are doing most of the rebuilding, she says. To pinpoint where the newly grown heart cells were coming from, developmental biologist Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte and his colleagues at the Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona,$$$Spain, and the Salk Institute in San Diego, California, developed zebrafish in which cardiomyocytes—mature heart muscle cells—glow green under fluorescent light. They removed 20% of the animals’ ventricle—considered the maximum survivable injury--and observed the fish as they repaired the wound. In $$$issue of Nature, the team reports that the new heart tissue also glowed green, indicating that it originated from the tagged cells rather than from unlabeled immature stem cells. Further experiments showed that the cardiomyocytes near the injury site seem to take a step backward in development, deta$$$from one another and losing their typical shape—presumably to make it possible for them to start dividing again as they replenish the lost tissue. Similar experiments by Kenneth Poss of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues also suggest that mature cardiac muscle cells are th$$$source of the zebrafish’s heart-repair kit. The researchers developed zebrafish in which cells turn green when they express a gene called gata4, which is turned on in embryonic hearts. In a second paper that will be published tomorrow in Nature, they report that after they removed part of a fish’s h$$$mature cells near the injury turned on gata4. The cells then started to divide and gave rise to the new heart tissue. Within 2 weeks, the new heart tissue was receiving electrical signals along with the healthy heart tissue. The next step, both teams say, is to identify the cellular signals that tri$$$the regrowth. Izpisúa Belmonte says that the de-differentiated cells he and his colleagues observed resemble so-called “hibernating cardiomyocytes” that scientists have observed in damaged mammal hearts. “The cells de-differentiate in a very similar way to zebrafish, but they don’t go to the next st$$$they don’t proliferate,” he says. He and his colleagues are testing different factors in mice to see if they can get around whatever is preventing the cells from dividing and making new tissue. “It seems that mammals try to [regenerate] as well. So maybe it isn’t so different after all,” he says. If$$$efficiency were all that matters, animals would hobble around like pirates with two peg legs. That's because, mathematically speaking, running with stiff legs requires less energy. But humans and many other animals have "squishy" legs, and a new simulation suggests why. When attached to real, floppy$$$bodies, so-called compliant legs prove more efficient, absorbing more force and offering more stability in rough terrain. The finding helps explain the long-puzzling paradox of why animals crouch and bounce as they run and may change how researchers model animal locomotion. From loping camels to scu$$$crabs, animals move in a variety of ways. Centuries of research have focused on why certain styles prevail--even Aristotle took a stab at it. In the 1970s, researchers began using mathematics and computers to model locomotion. That's when they ran into a problem: models predicted that stiff legs wer$$$most efficient, but real-world animals tended toward crouched, compliant motion. The paradox was especially pronounced among small animals, like rats and chickens, for which motion is costliest. Despite having to expend more energy and take more steps to cover a given distance, they adopt a crouched$$$Groucho Marx-style run. Squishy stability. Fleet-footed guinea fowl handle sudden drops with aplomb. A new model suggests their compliant legs stabilize their motion. Integrative physiologist Monica Daley of the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in Hatfield, U.K., had observed how adeptly the guinea fo$$$an African bird known for its running skill, negotiated sudden drops and other obstacles. She wondered how the shape of an animal's body and the nature of the terrain-details left out of earlier simulations because they're difficult to model-would alter the models' predictions. So she and RVC collea$$$James Usherwood devised a computer model that didn't sidestep the complexities of animal motion. Instead of attaching legs to an idealized point with a certain mass, the new model linked them to a bouncing body-the seesawing guts and other tissue an animal carries as it moves-and set them on an unev$$$course. As Daley expected, the less-idealized runners fared better on compliant legs. The spring in their step offset the bounce of their bodies, resulting in a smaller energy cost. "That's interesting and quite novel," says biomechanist Manoj Srinivasan of OhioStateUniversity in Columbus, who was n$$$involved with the research. Compliant legs also enabled runners to handle bigger obstacles without falling, an especially useful adaptation for the rough world in which smaller animals live, Daley explains. "What I want to do now is go out and measure this in real animals," says Daley. She plans to $$$the model, published online today in Biology Letters, to a spectrum of running birds ranging from quails to ostriches. Adding the floppiness of the upper body into motion research is an innovation, experts say. "This is a completely new approach," notes R. McNeill Alexander, a biomechanist at the Un$$$of Leeds in the United Kingdom and a pioneer of locomotion modeling. "No one had done anything quite like this before." Because of its use in those hard-to-treat diseases, thalidomide is still causing birth defects today—especially in Africa and South America where leprosy still rages. (In the Unite$$$States, people given thalidomide for myeloma are instructed to use multiple forms of birth control and take frequent pregnancy tests.) Scientists are therefore eager to understand exactly how thalidomide does its damage so that they can preserve the benefits of the drug without its hazards. Molecula$$$and developmental biologists from Japan report in tomorrow's issue of Science that they have found a new clue. Hiroshi Handa of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and his colleagues developed tiny magnetic beads—just 200 nanometers in diameter—that can be attached to drugs and other compounds. When t$$$bead-linked drugs are mixed with cell extracts, scientists can pick out proteins or other molecules that the drug binds to. They applied the technology to thalidomide, and their fishing expedition paid off. Handa's team found that beads tagged with thalidomide bound to a little-known protein called $$$which is expressed widely in both embryonic and adult tissues. Further experiments showed that blocking production of cereblon in zebrafish can cause defects in fin development similar to those caused by thalidomide. In both zebrafish and chick embryos, adding a version of cereblon that doesn't bind$$$to thalidomide seemed to blunt the drug's effects. Although cereblon's role in the cell is still unknown, Handa and his colleagues think that it might be a link between the drug and better-known developmental genes that direct limb development. But given that the protein is found in so many tissues,$$$it's puzzling that thalidomide has such specific effects on limbs, ears, eyes, gut, and kidneys. In part because of this, although the cereblon clue is interesting, it is far from the whole story, says Neil Vargesson, a developmental biologist at the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom. He $$$his colleagues have studied the activity of thalidomide in developing limbs and have shown that developing blood vessels are a primary target of the drug. The new experiments don't explain thalidomide's effects on blood vessels, he says. Toxicologist Craig Harris of the University of Michigan, Ann A$$$who has studied thalidomide's effects on gene expression, says that the new data are consistent with some theories of the drug's action, however. The cereblon clue will lead to new experiments that look at the protein's role in the cell, he says, key clues that may help scientists find replacement d$$$That, in turn, could finally relegate thalidomide to the history books. The cluster of seemingly nondescript cells that grows into a chick has a stronger sense of identity than you'd think. Rather than waiting for hormonal cues from the sex organs, the cells know whether they're male or female from $$$start, a new study reveals. The discovery challenges the standard picture of how sexual differences develop in vertebrates. In humans, somatic cells—the generic cells that grow into muscle, bone, and organs—start off unisex. Even though chromosomes mark the cells as male or female, they don't head d$$$that path until after the gonads—testes in a male, ovaries in a female—begin developing and secreting hormones at about 7 weeks. Sex is decided at this point by a key gene on the male-specific Y chromosome, which signals the embryo to develop testes. Hormones then drive the erstwhile unisex cells to$$$develop male or female features. For the past 50 years, biologists assumed that all vertebrates needed these cues before their cells took on a male or female identity. So Michael Clinton, a developmental biologist at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, couldn't understand why it was s$$$difficult to find the key sex-determining gene in chicken chromosomes. Then he got a call from an industry acquaintance who on his visits to poultry breeders occasionally noticed strange birds that were half brown and half white and had an oddly lopsided breast. Clinton agreed to take a look. The ch$$$were gynandromorphs, with their sex split down the middle. They appeared male on one side and female on the other. Unlike humans, where women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y, male chickens normally have two Z chromosomes, whereas females have a Z and a W chromosome. Clinton’s team s$$$blood and skin from both sides of each chicken, expecting to find that cells from one side or the other lacked a sex chromosome. This might give them a clue as to which chromosome, the Z or the W, held the key gene for determining sex-specific traits, Clinton thought. "It turned out that was complet$$$rubbish," Clinton says. Both sides of the chickens included normal male (ZZ) and female (ZW) cells. But male cells dominated one side, whereas female cells dominated the other, accounting for the split appearance. The same was true of cells taken from the chickens' breast muscles and wattles. This r$$$suggested that chicken cells, unlike mammalian cells, had their own sex identity that was to some extent independent of what hormones the gonads produced. Studies of normal chicken embryos bolstered the case. Just 18 hours after fertilization, long before gonads began to form, the embryos exhibited $$$"maleness" or "femaleness," as indicated by expression of sex-specific RNA molecules. To test whether these cells were really male or female, the team also removed them from early embryos that hadn't formed gonads yet and delicately placed them in eggs containing male and female chicks, creating par$$$gynandromorphs. After a week, some implanted cells had become part of the gonads of the opposite-sex host. But they resolutely held on to their sex identities, the team reports in tomorrow's issue of Nature. So instead of waiting for a cue from the gonads, somatic cells in chickens seem to know thei$$$own sex. The researchers speculate that the cells somehow drive masculine or feminine development, probably by triggering or repressing the activity of a gene called DMRT-1 on the Z chromosome. Last year, researchers found that suppressing this gene in male chick embryos made them develop a testis w$$$feminine characteristics. Although scientists had begun to suspect that the standard mammalian model for sex determination wasn't the whole story for all vertebrates, "this study very clearly shows it for the first time certainly in birds," says Craig Smith, a developmental biologist at the Murdoch $$$Research Institute in Parkville, Australia, whose team discovered DMRT-1. The mechanism "might be more pervasive amongst animals than we've thought." Are dolphins as smart as people? And if so, shouldn't we be treating them a bit better than we do now? Those were the topics of discussion at a sessio$$$on the ethical and policy implications of dolphin intelligence here today at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (which publishes ScienceNOW). First up, just how smart are dolphins? Researchers have been exploring the question for 3 decades, and the answer, $$$turns out, is pretty darn smart. In fact, according to panelist Lori Marino, an expert on cetacean neuroanatomy at Emory University in Atlanta, they may be Earth's second smartest creature (next to humans, of course). Marino bases her argument on studies of the dolphin brain. Bottlenose dolphins hav$$$bigger brains than humans (1600 grams versus 1300 grams), and they have a brain-to-body-weight ratio greater than great apes do (but lower than humans). "They are the second most encephalized beings on the planet," says Marino. But it's not just size that matters. Dolphins also have a very complex n$$$the part of the brain responsible for problem-solving, self-awareness, and variety of other traits we associate with human intelligence. And researchers have found gangly neurons called Von Economo neurons, which in humans and apes have been linked to emotions, social cognition, and even theory of m$$$ability to sense what others are thinking. Overall, said Marino, "dolphin brains stack up quite well to human brains." What dolphins do with their brains is also impressive. Cognitive psychologist Diana Reiss of Hunter College of the City University of New York brought the audience up to speed on th$$$latest on dolphin behavior. Reiss has been working with dolphins in aquariums for most of her life, and she says their social intelligence rivals that of the great apes. They can recognize themselves in a mirror (a feat most animals fail at—and a sign of self-awareness). They can understand complex $$$"sentences" from humans. And they can learn to poke an underwater keyboard to request toys to play with. "Much of their learning is similar to what we see with young children," says Reiss. So if dolphins are so similar to people, shouldn't we be treating them more like people? For example, should we$$$really being keeping them captive in zoos and aquariums? "The very traits that make dolphins interesting to study," says Marino, "make confining them in captivity unethical." She notes, for example, that in the wild, dolphins have a home range of about 100 square kilometers. In captivity, they roam $$$of 1% of this. Reiss is more concerned with the massive dolphin culling seen in some parts of the world. She showed graphic video of dolphins being drowned and stabbed as the waters turned red with blood in places such as the Japanese town of Taiji. Now that scientists know so much about how dolphin$$$think and feel, she said, they should use that data to build a bridge to the public—a big theme of this year's meeting. "Our scientific knowledge needs to be used to influence international policy and ethical considerations," she said. "Scientific facts should transcend geographic boundaries." Up la$$$Thomas White, a philosopher at Loyola Marymount University in Redondo Beach, California, made the argument that dolphins aren't merely like people—they may actually be people, or at least, "nonhuman persons," as he described them. Defining exactly what it means to be a person is difficult, White sai$$$but dolphins seem to fit the checklist many philosophers agree on: They're alive, aware of their environment, and have emotions—those ones are easy. But they also seem to have personalities, exhibit self-controlled behavior, and treat others appropriately, even ethically. That combination of traits $$$harder to come by in the animal world. When it comes to what defines a person, said White, "dolphins fit the bill." But before the researchers take their findings too far, experts caution that the scientific case for dolphin intelligence is based on relatively little data.  It's a pretty story, but $$$very speculative," says Jacopo Annese, a neuroanatomist at the University of California, San Diego. Despite a long history of research, scientists still don't agree on the roots of intelligence in the human brain, he says. "We don't know, even in humans, what is the relationship between brain struct$$$and function, let alone intelligence." ar less is known about dolphins, Annese says. And who wants to be like humans anyway? As one audience member noted, our conflicts kill and displace millions of our own species. "When we try to think about how we treat these creatures," he said, "we should also $$$about how we treat ourselves." For someone with a dangerous tumor, surgical removal of the cancer may bring immediate relief but leave the person with an uncertain future. Sometimes, remnant cancer cells resurge, and there's usually no easy way to tell when this is happening. A new technique that un$$$genetic glitches specific to each person's tumor could let doctors monitor for cancer recurrence simply by testing a blood sample. Cancer cells often have large-scale rearrangements of chromosomes that don't occur in normal cells and are easy to detect with current genetic methods. For example, pati$$$with chronic myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer, nearly always have swapped pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 in their cancer cells. Doctors can test for this glitch in blood cells to determine if a treatment is working. That hasn't been possible with solid tumors because no DNA rearrangement has been co$$$enough to generate a widely useful test for cancer patients. Instead, people often learn that their cancer has come back or spread only when they feel symptoms or the tumors show up with an imaging test such as a CT scan. Using next-generation DNA-sequencing machines, however, researchers at Johns H$$$University in Baltimore, Maryland, have found a way to use chromosomal arrangements to detect DNA from an individual's solid tumor. The team took biopsies of breast or colon cancer tumors from six cancer patients and sequenced the entire genome in each tumor's cells. In each case, the researchers id$$$rejiggered chromosomes specific to the tumor but not seen in a person's normal DNA. All six tumors had at least four unique chromosomal rearrangements, and some growths had as many as 15, cancer biologist Victor Velculescu and his team report 24 February in Science Translational Medicine and at the $$$meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Diego, California (AAAS publishes ScienceNOW). Next, the researchers showed that they could use a DNA-amplifying technique called polymerase chain reaction to detect the minute amounts of this distinctive tumor DNA in a sea of$$$normal DNA. The team also showed that the technique could pick out people with cancer: The blood of two people who had colon tumors that had not yet been removed tested positive for their specific cancer biomarker, whereas blood from healthy people tested negative. The researchers then used the pers$$$probes to track one of the colon cancer patients' responses to various treatments. The amount of cancer-specific DNA in the person's blood dropped in the hours after surgery, rose again during the next few weeks, and then dropped again after chemotherapy and surgery for a secondary tumor in the live$$$Oncologists could use these biomarkers to find out if a treatment is working or if surgery has missed some cancer cells, says Velculescu. Many clinical researchers are already using a different blood test to monitor patients' response to therapy—counting circulating tumor cells. But these cells are $$$rare and can't be detected in some patients. The chromosomal biomarkers should be much more sensitive and are "extraordinarily specific. The chance of getting a false positive is essentially zero," says Velculescu. Medical oncologist Klaus Pantel of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in$$$Germany, a leader in using circulating tumor cells to monitor cancer, says his group has thought about the same sequencing strategy. "My colleague will cry. It is a great approach." But as Pantel and the authors themselves note, the costs--$5000 per patient just to find the unique sequences—are too $$$for routine use. Geneticist Stephen Chanock of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, also cautions that before personalized genome-based cancer detection moves to the clinic, the Johns Hopkins team needs to sequence many more tumors to make sure that they always have characteristic ch$$$rearrangements and that these glitches don't disappear as the tumor mutates. A dose of the "trust hormone" oxytocin may help bring some autistic people out of their shell. Patients with the condition usually have a hard time interacting with others, but when they inhaled oxytocin in a new study, the$$$began looking at people in the eye and recognizing social concepts like fairness in a computer game. Although the results are preliminary, the work could lead to drugs to treat a variety of social disorders, including schizophrenia and anxiety, says expert Evdokia Anagnostou, a child neurologist at $$$Bloorview Research Institute in Toronto, Canada. Oxytocin appears to function as a sort of "social glue" for many mammals. Mice and monkeys release the hormone when they groom and mate, for example, and humans given a dose of oxytocin are more likely to offer a total stranger money, even if they don$$$get anything in return. Autistic people have less oxytocin circulating in their blood than those without the disorder, so neuroscientist Angela Sirigu of the Centre de Neuroscience Cognitive in Lyon, France, wondered whether ramping up the hormone would make them more socially adept. Sirigu's team a$$$13 adults with Asperger's Syndrome--a form of high-functioning autism--to play a computer game of toss. On the "field" were four boxes, indicating three players and the participant. To throw the ball to another player, the participant touched a given box. The computerized players were sometimes frie$$$meaning they threw the ball to other players, and sometimes bullies, meaning that they kept the ball to themselves. The volunteers received either a placebo or a nasal spray of oxytocin on one day and then swapped formulations a week later. That way, the researchers could observe how the same indivi$$$performed with and without the hormone boost. The oxytocin made a difference. Without the hormone boost, volunteers tended to play equally with the good guy and the bully, indicating their difficulty in grasping important social concepts like fairness and empathy. With the hormone, they tended to av$$$playing with the bully. In a second experiment, the researchers asked the volunteers to look at a series of faces on a computer monitor. Like many with autism, the subjects tended to fixate on the chin and mouth and rapidly shifted their gaze, indicating agitation. But when given oxytocin, they bega$$$looking at the person's eyes, a sign of social ease, the team reports online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Anagnostou agrees that autism patients who take oxytocin and then play the game appear to be learning how to interact with people. "There is, in fact, some f$$$of social learning that is happening," she says. But because this study only looked at the effect of oxytocin after a single dose, she adds, it's not clear if hormone boosters will continue working for the long term. In terms of therapeutic applications, Sirigu says that studies have shown that addr$$$autism early can sometimes help curb the condition. So administering a hormone like oxytocin during childhood may be a powerful weapon in fighting autism, she says. Anagnostou and her colleagues are currently administering oxytocin to Asperger's patients every day for 6 weeks. But even if her study $$$similar results, she says, it will still take years for researchers and doctors to figure out potential side effects and proper dosage levels for the hormone. Chimpanzees have an aggressive reputation and often fight rather than share. Bonobos, on the other hand, are famously playful and friendly. A$$$new study hints at a difference in how the two apes develop, suggesting that bonobos retain a youthful lack of social inhibition longer than chimpanzees do. Understanding how and why these two apes--the closest living relatives to humans--differ from each other could yield clues about how our own sp$$$evolved to be so social. Anatomical studies of ape skulls have suggested that bonobos' brains mature more slowly than those of chimps, says the lead author of the new study, Victoria Wobber, a graduate student in the lab of Harvard University primatologist Richard Wrangham. But no one had looked for$$$corresponding differences in the development of social behaviors in the two apes, Wobber says. So she and colleagues conducted experiments on about 60 apes of various ages at the Tchimpounga Sanctuary in the Republic of the Congo and the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of the Con$$$In the first experiment, the researchers put a bowl of fruit in an enclosure and allowed pairs of age-matched chimps or bonobos to enter. The apes scored high marks for social tolerance if they shared the food, particularly if they came close together and ate from the bowl at the same time. Young an$$$of both species were good at sharing, the researchers found. Although older bonobos appeared to maintain their youthful tolerance, chimps tended to be less tolerant with age. In pairs of older chimps, the more dominant one often hogged all the food. And even when sharing occurred, two individuals ra$$$ate from the bowl at the same time. A second experiment tested social inhibitions. In this setup, a chimp or bonobo faced three people standing in a row. The two people on the outside reached into a bowl and took a piece of fruit, and then all three people held out a closed fist. Chimpanzees of all $$$and older bonobos ignored the middle person, whom they knew had no food to offer, and approached the people on the ends to beg. Young bonobos, however, couldn't restrain themselves from pestering the middle person, too, suggesting that in this species, social inhibition develops later than it does i$$$chimps. In a related experiment, young bonobos were slower to catch on when a formerly generous person stopped handing out fruit--more evidence, Wobber says, that their social inhibition develops later. The findings, published today in Current Biology, suggest to Wobber that different rates of brain$$$development might account for differences in social cognition in the two apes. Humans grow up more slowly than either ape, she notes, and other researchers have proposed that this extended childhood could be related to our species' very social nature (Science, 14 November 2008, p. 1040).

Haile Gebrselassie, the world's fastest marathoner, once said of his early career, "When I wore shoes, it was difficult." A new study reveals why: Humans run differently in bare feet. Researchers have discovered that sneakers and other sports shoes alter our$$$natural gait, which normally protects us from the impact of running. The finding offers new insight on how early humans ran and raises concerns that sports shoes may promote more injuries than they prevent. About 2 million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans evolved the physiological "equipmen$$$for running--long legs, large buttocks, and springy structures in the feet, among other features. Athletic shoes weren't invented until the early 1900s, and it wasn't until the 1970s that they found widespread popularity. So how did humans manage to run comfortably before the invention of purpose-bu$$$footwear? Daniel Lieberman, a human evolutionary biologist at Harvard University--and an avid runner--decided to find out. He and colleagues looked at more than 200 shod and unshod runners in the United States and the Rift Valley Province of Kenya, which is known for its great endurance runners. The$$$volunteers represented a spectrum of shoe experience, including adults who had grown up wearing shoes, those who had grown up running shoeless but who now wore shoes, and those who had never worn shoes at all. Lieberman's team arranged a trial in which each group ran shod (either in ASICS GEL-Cumulu$$$10s or in their own shoes) and bare and measured their running gait and the impact on their bodies. The researchers noticed a difference right away. Whereas shod runners tended to land on the heel of the foot, barefoot runners landed on the ball of the foot or with a flat foot. The unshod runners' s$$$causes more flex in the foot's springlike arch, ankle, and knee and engages more foot and calf muscles, blunting the impact on the body and making for a more comfortable "ride." As their feet collide with the ground--in this case, a running track--barefoot runners experience a shock of only 0.5 to 0$$$times their body weight, whereas shod heel strikers experience 1.5 to two times their body weight--a threefold to fourfold difference. "I always assumed it was painful and crazy to run barefoot," says a surprised Lieberman. Instead, the findings--published tomorrow in Nature--suggest that going bare$$$can reduce the likelihood of pain and damage, because many running injuries, like shin splints and plantar fasciitis, are stress- and impact-induced. "This is an excellent study," says Dennis Bramble, an evolutionary morphologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. "Heel strikes don't allow$$$you to use these really nifty springs that are unique to human beings, so we're being less efficient than we could be," he says. "It confirms what we should have known all along: We're built to run barefoot." That confirmation will stoke an ongoing debate. As a glance at this month's Runner's World $$$and a recent book on shoeless running called Born to Run attest, barefoot running has gained a small but devoted following in the past decade, prompting controversy in the running community over whether it is best to run shod or unshod. So should sporty types shed their shoes and jump on the barefoo$$$bandwagon? "Not at all," says Lieberman. "Shoes are comfortable, and they protect the foot" from glass, asphalt, and other harsh realities of urban running, he notes. Instead, Lieberman (who has since taken up occasional barefoot running himself) recommends a gradual transition for the bare-curious,$$$one that allows the feet and calves to strengthen slowly and avoid injury.

Researchers now believe they've demonstrated which part of the brain allows us to make moral judgments of another person's motives, a find that could lead to a greater understanding of Asperger syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders. Scientists already have som$$$clues about how we judge the actions of another person. Previous research using functional magnetic resonance imaging, a method of imaging activity in the brain, has shown that an area just above the right ear called the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) receives more blood than usual when we re$$$about people’s beliefs and intentions, particularly if we use the information to judge people negatively. But it's not possible to say from a simple observational study whether the brain activity is actually necessary to make such a judgment or whether making the negative judgment causes this region$$$to become more active. So social neuroscientist Liane Young of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and colleagues decided to turn off the right temporoparietal junction and see whether people would make different judgments of others' actions. They achieved this using transcranial $$$stimulation (TMS), a technology that uses a tightly focused magnetic field to temporarily disable individual regions of the brain. The researchers aimed the device either at the RTPJ or at a nearby region of the brain not thought to be involved in cognitive processing. Subjects between the ages of 1$$$and 30 read stories containing a series of hypothetical scenarios on a computer screen. In some, person A accidentally killed person B; in others, person A intended to kill person B but failed. Subjects were asked to rate from one to seven how excusable they found person A's conduct from “not at all$$$to “completely.” The subjects considered some scenarios with their temporoparietal junction turned off and other scenarios with the area functioning as normal. In both cases, volunteers judged unsuccessful attempts at murder to be more egregious than cases of accidental killing. However, subjects we$$$significantly more forgiving of attempted murder when their right temporoparietal junctions were knocked out by TMS than when they were functioning normally, the team reports online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The findings imply that activity in the region is requir$$$for us to properly judge another person's motives, say the researchers. The team is now working with Asperger sufferers: psychologists believe that Asperger syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders are characterized by an inability to discern other people’s intentions.

Here's a study to file under "unworkable but very cool." A group of Japanese researchers has developed a mosquito that spreads vaccine instead of disease. Even the researchers admit, however, that regulatory and ethical problems will prevent the critters from ever tak$$$wing—at least for the delivery of human vaccines. Scientists have dreamed up various ways to tinker with insects' DNA to fight disease. One option is to create strains of mosquitoes that are resistant to infections with parasites or viruses, or that are unable to pass the pathogens on to humans. The$$$would somehow have to replace the natural, disease-bearing mosquitoes, which is a tall order. Another strategy closer to becoming reality is to release transgenic mosquitoes that, when they mate with wild-type counterparts, don't produce viable offspring. That would shrink the population over time. $$$new study relies on a very different mechanism: Use mosquitoes to become what the scientists call "flying vaccinators." Normally, when mosquitoes bite, they inject a tiny drop of saliva that prevents the host's blood from clotting. The Japanese group decided to add an antigen-a compound that trigger$$$an immune response-to the mix of proteins in the insect's saliva. A group by led by molecular geneticist Shigeto Yoshida of Jichi Medical University in Tochigi, Japan, identified a region in the genome of Anopheles stephensi-a malaria mosquito-called a promoter that turns on genes only in the insect$$$saliva. To this promoter they attached SP15, a candidate vaccine against leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease spread by sand flies that can cause skin sores and organ damage. Sure enough, the mosquitoes produced SP15 in their saliva, the team reports in the current issue of Insect Molecular Biology. A$$$when the insects were allowed to feast on mice, the mice developed antibodies against SP15. Antibody levels weren't very high, and the team has yet to test whether they protect the rodents against the disease. (Only very few labs have the facilities for so-called challenge studies with that disease,$$$says Yoshida.) In the experiment, mice were bitten some 1500 times on average; that may seem very high, but studies show that in places where malaria is rampant, people get bitten more than 100 times a night, Yoshida points out. In the meantime, the group has also made mosquitoes produce a candidate$$$malaria vaccine. Other researchers are wowed by the achievement. "The science is really beautiful," says Jesus Valenzuela of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, who developed the SP15 vaccine. David O'Brochta, an insect molecular geneticist at the Univers$$$of Maryland, College Park, calls it "a fascinating proof of concept." So why won't it fly? There's a huge variation in the number of mosquito bites one person received compared with the next, so people exposed to the transgenic mosquitoes would get vastly different doses of the vaccine; it would be $$$bit like giving some people one measles jab and others 500 of them. No regulatory agency would sign off on that, says molecular biologist Robert Sinden of Imperial College London. Releasing the mosquitoes would also mean vaccinating people without their informed consent, an ethical no-no. Yoshida co$$$that the mosquito would be "unacceptable" as a human vaccine-delivery mechanism. However, flying vaccinators-or "flying syringes" as some have dubbed them -may have potential in fighting animal disease, says O'Brochta. Animals don't need to give their consent, and the variable dosage would be less o$$$a concern. Researchers have discovered that an array of radio transceivers--devices that send and receive signals--can track people's movements behind walls. Possible uses include detecting people trapped in burning buildings, controlling lighting or heating and cooling systems as people enter or ex$$$rooms, and spotting burglars or enemy soldiers. The technology is based on the fact that human beings absorb radio waves. The phenomenon is called multipath fading, and it causes the sudden static on an AM radio in a room where people are moving around. Electrical engineer Neal Patwari of the Univer$$$of Utah in Salt Lake City had been working on ways to overcome multipath fading when he decided to turn the problem on its head. Why not use fading for a different purpose: to locate someone or something moving? The advantage of radio waves is that, unlike visible light, they can be detected at nigh$$$and in dust, smoke, or fog. Patwari and his team developed software that displays on a screen the approximate position of someone moving within a cordon of radio transceivers. The experiments started in 2007, Patwari says, but the results were spotty because the team was "using clunky hardware and t$$$system was not real time." But as doctoral student Joey Wilson and Patwari will report in an upcoming issue of Transactions on Mobile Computing, they were eventually able to create a prototype wireless network of pole-mounted, cell phone–sized transceivers that they tested outdoors and indoors. In b$$$cases, the prototype system worked well and in real time. By measuring the radio-signal strength from all the transceivers while Wilson walked around inside the array, the system could calculate his location with an accuracy of about 1 meter. One advantage of the transceiver array is that it could b$$$set up and dismantled quickly, around a military encampment or burning house, for example. But a few bugs must be worked out before the system is ready for commercialization, Patwari says. For one thing, the prototype's frequency can be jammed, which might limit its usefulness for security systems. $$$solution might be to program the software to instantly switch frequencies if the signal is interrupted. The research has yielded "an interesting way of taking a long-standing technical problem, creating a new type of technology using existing hardware, and applying it in ways that can help in emerge$$$says electrical engineer Jeff Frolik of the University of Vermont, Burlington. The vision is bold and admirable. But Canada's plans for a major Arctic research initiative are entirely inadequate. That's the blunt verdict today from a blue-chip international panel asked to review the project. The Can$$$Arctic Research Initiative (CARI), complete with research programs and a world-class research station, was pegged as a government priority by Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper in October 2007. It's part of a larger northern strategy aimed at asserting sovereignty and promoting economic deve$$$in the region. But Harper didn't provide any details about what it would do or how the science would be carried out. The review by the 13-member panel, assembled by the Council of Canadian Academies and led by Elizabeth Dowdeswell, a former U.N. under-secretary general and chair of the council's sci$$$advisory committee, is part of an ongoing effort to flesh out that vision. The panel said the government needs to have a better idea of what it wants to achieve. Canada has acquired a reputation among Arctic nations for failing to match words with deeds," declares the final report. In particular, th$$$panel found fault with the four priorities established after an extensive consultative process this year with academia, the private sector, and aboriginal organizations. The priorities--sustainable resource development, environmental science and stewardship, climate change, and healthy and sustainab$$$communities--"are too general to provide practical direction over time," it notes. One big problem, says the expert panel, is that those priorities are really themes rather than a research agenda. "They do not take full advantage of Canada's opportunities, and do not fully respond to Canada's intern$$$obligations with respect to Arctic science," it continues. At the same time, the panel writes, the government should consider expanding those priorities to include baseline monitoring of environmental phenomena and technologies related to data collection, remote sensing, and telemedicine. Equally wo$$$the panel says, are Canada's plans for the physical infrastructure to be associated with the initiative. Among options proposed was a single station, something more virtual in nature, or a "hub and spoke model," with a main, central facility and a bushel of smaller, strategically situated scientific$$$sites. The last is probably the best option, the report says. The experts also implore the government to provide adequate long-term funding for the initiative and to give it a kick-start with "one or more long-term core programs." That advice resonates with Danielle Labonté, an administrator with In$$$and Northern Affairs Canada who's leading the government's effort to define and implement CARI. At a briefing this week before a committee that advises the U.S. National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, Labonté explained that CARI "needs to be a network that connects many activities sp$$$the entire region. One building won't do it." The government has not yet assigned the project a budget or set a timetable for completion, although Labonté said that half a dozen communities have already expressed interest in hosting the central facility. Letters The account of the international pane$$$report on Canada's proposed Arctic Research Initiative (CARI) may have created a misleading impression of the panel's actual conclusions. The 13-person independent panel of experts, which I had the privilege of chairing, did not conclude that "Canada's plans for a major Arctic research initiative ar$$$entirely inadequate." The panel, which was assembled by the Council of Canadian Academies at the request of the Government of Canada, was asked to provide an international perspective on reports and consultations undertaken to begin conceptualization of this important initiative. (CARI is not expect$$$to be fully operational for about ten years.) The panel unhesitatingly endorsed the CARI initiative noting that it responds to Canada's international obligation with respect to arctic science. This obligation stems from Canada's stewardship of human and natural resources in the arctic that are of cr$$$global importance. Indeed, our understanding of the world's north polar region and its relationship to many global environmental processes will depend on the kind of Canadian participation that CARI aims to support. Of course the panel, as it was asked to do, provided some suggestions to further the$$$good preliminary thinking done so far. In particular we emphasized the importance of long-term monitoring and the role of leading-edge technologies as the fundamental enablers of cutting-edge arctic research. We urged that a thoroughly multidisciplinary perspective be built into CARI from the outset$$$This also implies partnership with indigenous peoples in Canada's north and with the international polar research community.

In the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya, there's an area local fishermen call "Turtle Island." It's real enough, but you'd be foolish to try to sail there. The island is never in precisely the same place, and it changes size from one minute to the next. In fact, you neve$$$know when its gleaming shore might disappear altogether, because it's made up entirely of the half-exposed shells of basking loggerhead sea turtles. The funny thing is, sea turtles, unlike the Mediterranean's human denizens, aren't supposed to like to float, says Sandra Hochscheid, a marine biologis$$$at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples, Italy. Scientists believe that loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), the dominant sea turtle in the Mediterranean, spend most of their lives underwater or on the sea floor, coming to the surface only for brief gasps of air. "Everything we'd found out $$$turtles: feeding, mating, migrating, searching for good places, resting … has all taken place underwater," she says. Hochscheid knew about Turtle Island and had heard about basking turtles from tourists in Naples, but she'd never seen the behavior for herself. So she decided to figure out just what $$$loggerheads were doing spending so much time among the waves. "I've been looking 10 years into what they do under the water surface," Hochscheid says. "But I've never looked at the time they spend at the surface." Hochscheid and colleagues collected 10 loggerheads from various locations in the Medit$$$and glued tracking devices—small black boxes with flexible antennas—to their shells. Over a year of observations, it became clear why the turtles had developed a reputation as bottom dwellers. The tagged loggerheads spent about 98% of their time underwater. And when they did come up, it was irregula$$$sometimes twice in 2 days and sometimes not for a week. There was a hint to the reason for the behavior, however. The turtles almost always surfaced during the day, 82% of the time, in fact, and mostly at about midday when the sunlight is most direct. Another clue: Daylight basking sessions almost a$$$occurred after the turtles had returned from a dive below the thermocline, the transitional zone between the sun-warmed shallows and frigid depths. Hochscheid believes that daylight surfacing helps the loggerheads warm up quickly; she speculates it could also aid digestion, though she's not sure how$$$Night surfacing, on the other hand, almost always followed dives that were long enough to cause the turtles to run out of air, a duration that the team calculated based on the turtles' weight.

He says that if more research uncovers a preference for certain spots or times of year, the findings could feed into conservation efforts.

But about 50% of Asians and 5% of Europeans have mutations in these enzymes that can increase the rate of alcohol metabolism up to 100-fold.

In 2008, a team led by geneticist Kenneth Kidd of Yale University found that one of these mutations--known as ADH1B*47His--may have been favored by natural selection in many East Asian populations. A team led by Bing Su, a geneticist at the Kunmi$$$Institute of Zoology in China, set out to find the source of this selection. The researchers searched for the ADH1B*47His mutation in 2275 people across China representing 38 ethnic groups. They found that it was highly prevalent, up to 99%, in ethnic groups from southeast China; a bit less prevalen$$$60% to 70%, in western China; and relatively uncommon, 14%, among Tibetans. Moreover, the team found a strong geographical correlation between regions with a high prevalence of the mutation and archaeological sites in China where rice had been domesticated thousands of years ago. When Su and his col$$$calculated the age of the mutation, it came out at between 7000 and 10,000 years ago. That corresponds roughly to the earliest known evidence for rice farming, the team reports online this week in BMC Evolutionary Biology. "The [mutation] rose to extremely high frequency in a relatively short time, $$$that the selective force was quite strong," Su says. As for what the selective pressure was, the team concludes that the mutation was favored because it protected early farmers from the potentially fatal harms of drinking too much. The researchers cite two additional pieces of evidence for this hypo$$$First, recent archaeological evidence suggests that Chinese farmers concocted an alcoholic brew of rice, honey, and grape or hawthorn as early as 9000 years ago. Second, the drug disulfiram, which causes acetaldehyde to accumulate in the body, discourages alcoholics from drinking by causing nausea, $$$and other severe alcohol flush reaction symptoms. "This study is the latest in a growing body of research showing just how important human culture has been as a transformational force in human evolution," says Darren Curnoe, an anthropologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia$$$Indeed, the rise of farming has been linked to evolutionary changes in genes for other enzymes, such as amylase, which breaks down starch, and lactase, which breaks down lactose in milk. Other researchers are not entirely convinced. Kidd says that the hypothesis is "quite reasonable" but that it's s$$$speculation at this point. He also questions whether the team has determined the age of the mutation correctly, because the estimates range over at least 3000 years. And Dorian Fuller, an archaeologist at University College London, argues that the team may be wrong to pin the mutation's origins sole$$$on rice cultivation. The archaeological sites the researchers chose, he says, included settlements where rice had just begun to be farmed and those where rice farming was in full flower. Fuller adds that if the team had restricted its analysis to those later sites where rice had become a predominant$$$crop, beginning about 8000 years ago, then alcoholic beverages could also have been made from grapes--and rice might not be solely responsible for the Asian Flush.

A new study argues that the structures really emerged to help keep fish in chemical balance with their environment. The first person to sugge$$$that fish develop gills to breathe was Nobel Prize–winning physiologist August Krogh in the 1940s. Later, other researchers expanded the theory, arguing that, as fish became larger and more predatory hundreds of millions of years ago, their rudimentary gills became larger and more complex to help th$$$draw more oxygen from the water. Studies over the past decade have hinted at a different explanation. In order to keep from shriveling like your fingers in the bathtub, fish must constantly exchange ions, such as sodium and potassium, with the water. Larval fish can exchange ions through their skin,$$$and early fish likely used rudimentary gill structures known as branchial baskets. But when the salinity of the water changes rapidly--as happened when fish invaded freshwater habitats--fish would have needed a much more efficient way of exchanging ions with their environment. That means large, comp$$$gills. "It's always hard not to believe what a Nobel Prize winner has put forward," says Peter Rombough, a biologist at Brandon University in Manitoba, Canada. "But we began to accumulate evidence, and it didn't seem to fit with the theory." In the new study, Rombough and colleagues looked at rainbo$$$trout, a common laboratory animal. The researchers wanted to know if the fledgling gills first exchange ions or oxygen--a clue to which activity evolved first. The team placed the rainbow trout larvae in a box with two compartments: one for the head, where gills develop, and one for the tail. Claric$$$Fu, then a graduate student at the University of British Columbia in Canada, measured ion and oxygen levels at both ends of the larvae. After about 15 days, gills were exchanging more ions than the tail was. It took another 10 days or so for the same thing to happen with oxygen, the researchers repo$$$online this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. To Rombough and Fu, this suggests that gills first evolved to transfer ions. Greg Goss, a biologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, says the study has made him much more confident in the hypothesis that gills evolved to exchange ion$$$But he'd still like to know which genes turn on first--those involved in oxygen exchange or those involved in ion exchange. And Pung-Pung Hwang, a zoologist at the Academia Sinica in Taipei, says the team also needs to look at more-ancient fish, such as lamprey and sturgeon, as well as fish living i$$$saltwater. Meanwhile, the study raises concerns for the modern day, Rombough says. Industrial runoff and other pollution has filled Earth's oceans with metals that poison fish. With fish larvae relying on gills to exchange ions at just 2 weeks of age, fish may be more vulnerable to these pollutants $$$scientists realize. If ion exchange is blocked in fish, he says, "eventually they're just as dead as if they didn't have oxygen."

But one day she scattered dandelions, a favorite snack, near a female tortoise named Wilhelmina, who began to eat. A second tortoise ignored a clump that had fallen near him and followed Wilhelmina to her clump ins$$$This made Wilkinson wonder whether the second tortoise had "learned that the dandelions were there" by observing where Wilhelmina was eating. So Wilkinson set out to test whether tortoises learned a navigation task better by watching other tortoises or on their own. She set up a v-shaped wire fence $$$placed a bowl containing a few tidbits of strawberry and mushroom inside the fence at the point of the "V". Then she set Wilhelmina outside the tip of the "V", with the treats on the other side of the fence.

The fact that it took so long to train Wilhelmina, whereas tortoises who watched the demonstration could learn the maneuver much more quickly, is the best piece of evidence against$$$the hypothesis that the evolutionary pressures of group living sharpened social learning in gregarious species, says Jennifer Templeton, an ecologist at KnoxCollege in Galesburg, Illinois. Although the results challenge the hypothesis, "I just don't think they challenge it very well," Templeton says$$$To disprove it, the researchers would have to show that the tortoises that watched Wilhelmina didn't simply have more environmental clues telling them how to complete the task, something Templeton doubts. But Louis Lefebvre, an animal behaviorist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, argues that$$$"there's been evidence for a long time" against the hypothesis that learning from others is a novel ability that evolved separately from other types of learning.

Humans began living in large communities only about 10,000 years ago. Yet most of us tend to treat those around us fairly, even if they're not close friends and relatives.

The idea was to cover communities as varied as hunter-gath$$$groups comprising no more than several dozen people and modern communities of several thousand members. Societies were assessed by three measures: size, degree of "market integration" (food purchased rather than caught or grown), and membership in a world religion—a marker for having a moral code th$$$extends beyond kin to people in general. The subjects were given three tests that revealed their willingness to punish selfishness—even at a cost to the punisher. In one, the Dictator Game, volunteers simply decided how to split an amount of money—equivalent to a local day's wages—with a member of t$$$community who was kept anonymous by being kept out of sight of the subject. In the second, the Ultimatum Game, a subject split money with an anonymous person. The stranger could refuse the offer as unfair, in which case neither party got any money. In the final test, the Third Party Punishment Game,$$$the subject made an offer to an anonymous person, and a third party decided whether the offer was fair. If he decided it wasn't, both he and the initial offerer lost money. In both the second and third games, punishers pay a price because they get more money if they abide by an unfair decision. Memb$$$of large, complex communities had both a keener sense of fairness and a greater willingness to punish unfairness, the team reports in tomorrow's issue of Science. In fact, on the three tests, the money offered by subjects from the largest societies ranged from 25% to 51% higher than the offers by su$$$from the smallest subsistence-based groups. With the latter groups "you get results in those experiments that look nothing like what you get with university students," the subjects commonly used by researchers in such experiments, Henrich says.

The findings argue against the conventional evolutionary psychology hypothesis that ideas of fairness and punishment are just evolutionary holdovers, says anthropologist of Robert Boyd of the University of California, Los Angeles. "If this were just the Pleistocene psychology working it$$$out, you would not expect to see these systematic differences between societies." In other words, fairness to strangers—who would be regarded with antagonism or at least mistrust in small, close-knit hunter-gatherer groups—is a behavior that has evolved along with other norms in complex societies.

Digging in the frozen tundra of Norway's Svalbard archipelago, scientists have uncovered the remains of the most ancient polar bear ever found. DNA analyses reveal that the bear—a mature male—lived about 120,000 years ago, at a time when wooly mammoths $$$also roaming the land. The work also shows that this bear represents something very rare in the fossil record: an evolutionary snapshot of one species turning into another.

The new research "conclusively resolves a diversity of opinion about how recently polar bears evolved," says Stirling, who was not involved in the rese$$$The mystery has been solved thanks to a very lucky find. In 2004, Icelandic geologist Ólafur Ingólfsson of the University of Iceland was working on Svalbard. While studying sediment layers in the island's coastal cliffs, he accidentally discovered a lower jawbone belonging to a large predator. Ingól$$$gave the bone to researchers at the University of Oslo's Natural History Museum, who, along with colleagues, have studied it for several years. Based on its shape and chemistry, the researchers have determined that the jaw belonged to a bear that ate marine organisms. And its location in the sedimen$$$places its age at somewhere between 110,000 and 130,000 years old, which would make about twice as old as the oldest polar bear remains ever found. But in order to figure out if the fossil truly represented a polar bear, the researchers needed DNA. They got it by drilling into a canine tooth in the $$$and extracting fragments of mitochondrial DNA, the genetic material passed down directly from mother to child. That DNA identified the species as Ursus maritimus, the modern polar bear, the team reports online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mapping the complete mitocho$$$genome for such an old specimen is "an impressive feat," says geneticist Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen. When the researchers compared the fossil's DNA with analogous DNA from six other specimens of living brown bears and polar bears, they detected genetic hallmarks of both species.$$$That suggests that the fossil bear was one of the first polar bears to branch off from brown bears.

The origin of the domestic dog is a hot topic in evolutionary biology. Scientists agree that today's Fidos came from the domestication of the gray wolf, but they are at odd$$$over where this took place. Previous genetic studies focusing on mitochondrial DNA—inherited only from the mother—have suggested that modern domestic dogs are descended from animals that lived in East Asia between 5000 and 16,000 years ago. But archaeological excavations in Europe and the Middle Eas$$$have found remains of what appear to be domestic dogs dating back as far as 31,000 years. Now, a team led by evolutionary geneticist Melissa Gray of the University of California, Los Angeles, has examined nuclear DNA to fill in a crucial piece of the puzzle. The researchers took samples of blood, ti$$$or saliva from three populations: large domestic dogs (those weighing more than 30 kilograms), small dogs (weighing less than 9 kilograms), and wild wolves, foxes, and coyotes from around the world. They then looked at a gene called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). All canines, wild or domestic,$$$have some form of this gene—precisely which form is strongly associated with the size of an animal's skeleton. The team found that the version of IGF1 carried by all small dogs is found in very few large dogs and no wild canines. But a very similar form of the gene is found in gray wolves from the M$$$East. That means that this region is probably the birthplace of the common ancestor of all the world's small dogs. Because they all carry the same variant, it is extremely unlikely that small body size evolved more than once. And for the gene to have had time to spread all over the world, it must ha$$$evolved shortly after dogs were first domesticated. Gray emphasizes that the study, published today in BMC Biology, doesn’t necessarily mean that dogs were first domesticated in the Middle East. But it's a "strong indication" that that region “has played a significant role in the early history of do$$$dogs.” The authors note that archaeologists have found remains of small dogs dating to 12,000 years ago in the area.

Is evolution doing linear algebra when it creates new species? An analysis by a team of evolutionary biologists and applied mathematicians indicates that may be the case, at least for one famous evolutionary feature: the beaks of$$$Darwin's finches. Charles Darwin was intrigued by the variety of finches on his visit to the Galápagos Islands in 1835.

Wondering if there was some sort of mathematical pattern behind the adaptations, a team from Harvard University, including postdoc Otger Campàs and grad student Ricardo Mallarino, analyzed the beak shapes of 13 of Darwin's f$$$including six species in the genus Geospiza and three in the genus Camarhynchus. Using carefully digitized profiles from specimens in Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, the researchers then set out to see to what extent linear transformations-the simplest mathematical functions that can act on$$$geometric objects-could "collapse" the two-dimensional curves representing the finches' upper beaks onto a common shape. Mathematically, any two curves are related by some kind of transformation. But linearity imposes severe constraints. In two dimensions, it allows shapes to change only via scaling$$$and shearing. Roughly speaking, a scaling transformation is one that stretches or squeezes two perpendicular axes but keeps them perpendicular, while a shear transformation shoves one axis toward the other, changing the angle between them. The researchers found that the six Geospiza finches and thei$$$ancestor the Black-faced Grassquit matched up with scaling transformations alone. The other 6 specimens also matched up using scaling alone. The two groupings became one via shear, the team reports online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "We were quite shocked that t$$$all collapsed so well," says study co-author Michael Brenner. "At the moment, this is just empirical," he adds. "We're trying to figure out what it means." The answer, whatever it turns out to be, likely lies in the details of gene expression. Study co-author Arkhat Abzhanov and colleagues had alrea$$$established that two proteins are largely responsible for beak shape in Geospiza--calmodulin controls length, while bmp4 affects width and depth-so "we were expecting that there would be some kind of correspondence between these beaks," Mallarino says. "But the fact that we got such clean levels of $$$is indeed very surprising." Presumably the same or similar proteins are involved in the second group, but those studies are yet to be done.

Charles Stevens, a molecular biologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, California, who has studied the interplay between evolution and groups of mathematical transformations, agrees that the Harvard group is onto something. "The trick now is to find the c$$$pattern formation rules for gene networks that have the property of giving rise to all these groups," he says.

How did orchids, daisies, and their ilk become so dominant? Researchers have long chalked it up to their flowers, which enlist insects and other animals to help them reproduce and spread. But two plant biologists credit the leaves instead. More le$$$veins made the plants better photosynthesizers, the duo reports, enabling angiosperms to outgrow their competition. The two researchers--Timothy Brodribb, a hydraulic physiologist at the University of Tasmania in Australia, and Taylor Feild, now at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville--were studyi$$$how leaves transport water. They noticed that the leaves of early angiosperms seemed to contain far fewer veins than those of angiosperms that evolved later. "We were shocked by the extraordinary contrast," Brodribb recalls. Their work has shown that the density of veins is important to the ability $$$the plant to photosynthesize. To grow, plants must take in carbon dioxide through valves in the leaves called stomata. When open, stomata lose water, so the more efficient the transport of water to replenish lost moisture, the more stomata that can stay open and take up carbon dioxide. The researche$$$wondered if the evolution of more veins per leaf gave angiosperms the boost they needed to become widespread. Based on fieldwork in 13 countries over 6 years, the duo examined the venation of 504 flowering plants and 225 other plants, including 166 extinct species, and looked for trends in venation $$$through time. In addition, they measured water and carbon dioxide exchange in leaves from 35 species of flowering and nonflowering plants. "The evidence for a transformation in venation was remarkably clear," says Brodribb. Early angiosperms had simple leaf patterns with few veins. But about 100 mil$$$years ago, newer species of angiosperms had doubled, tripled, and, ultimately, increased by 10-fold the number of leaf veins, the team reported online last week in Ecology Letters. According to the researchers' model of plant physiology, a tripling of vein density would have doubled the plant's phot$$$capacity. Brodribb and Feild argue that more photosynthesis meant more carbon for growth. And that would have given the angiosperms the energy to push competitors like conifers out of the canopy around 150 million years ago, making angiosperms the most productive group of land plants in the world. F$$$play a role in the diversification, the team says, but leaf veins help these plants become so abundant. "The importance of vein density has never before been so clearly presented," says Peter Wilf, a paleobotanist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park.

It's not quite Shakespearean wordplay, but a species of African monkey can modify individual warning calls to produce novel meanings, according to new research. And because the wild monkeys tack the same sound onto the end of their c$$$the authors speculate that they could resemble suffixes. But it's debatable whether the sounds serve a grammatical purpose like that in human language. Campbell's monkeys, noted for their grizzled faces and tuft of orange fur on top of their heads, live in the dense rainforest of Western Africa. Lik$$$many species of monkeys, they use various warning calls: "Hok" is for eagles, "krak" is for leopards, and "boom" is for nonpredatory disturbances, such as a branch falling from a tree. The monkeys can even combine different calls to form new messages. For example, to signal less-dangerous situations$$$Campbell's monkeys holler "boom-boom" followed by "krak" or "hok." This tells other monkeys that the predator is far away, so there is no immediate need to flee. But scientists were skeptical that monkeys could modify individual calls, because the primates appear to lack the appropriate anatomy for $$$vocalization. To find out how rich the vocal repertoire of monkeys really is, Alban Lemasson, a primatologist at the University of Rennes 1 in France, and his colleagues traveled to the Ivory Coast and monitored the alarm calls of Campbell's monkeys for 2 years. They found that monkeys have six alar$$$calls, twice as many as previously thought. The primates doubled their call repertoire by adding "oo" to their specific predator calls. "Hok-oo" and "wak-oo" became a general alert for a canopy disturbance, whether an eagle or a flying squirrel, and "krak-oo" signaled almost any disturbance. This tr$$$allows monkeys to sidestep their limited vocal range and produce more messages, the team reported last month in PLoS ONE. "The monkeys used a suffix system to create new calls," Lemasson says. "To my knowledge, this has never been shown before in animal communication." The study suggests that the ab$$$to modify words to produce new meanings evolved independently from human language, Lemasson says. He speculates that the density of the forest habitat puts selection pressure on Campbell's monkeys to develop a richer set of vocalizations, because it is challenging to communicate visually. "I'm sure $$$if we continue working with these species, we will discover additional vocal abilities," he says. Evolutionary biologist Thore Bergman of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the work is promising but that it's unclear how analogous the monkey-call modifications are to human suffix usage. To $$$this, he says, scientists will have to show that monkeys react as if they understand the different meanings of the calls when scientists play back the alarm sounds, with and without the suffix. If the findings hold up, he says, it will be an important advance in understanding how our own language ab$$$evolved. "We're running out of things that make human language unique." Charles Darwin just got a 200th birthday present: a newly discovered fossil of a crow-sized flying reptile. Named Darwinopterus ("Darwin's wing") in his honor, the find closes a gap in the fossil record and might provide an impo$$$new clue about how natural selection works. Darwinopterus is a pterosaur, a member of the group of reptiles that soared above the landscape for much of the Mesozoic era. They appeared about 220 million years ago and vanished 65 million years ago, along with the dinosaurs. For years, scientists have $$$over the fact that the fossil record features two types of pterosaurs but no intermediates. Looking vaguely like primitive pheasants, the oldest members of the group had long tails and short skulls, along with short hands.

The fossil's 20-centimeter-long skull and neck resemble those of the later group of pterosaurs, and the rest of the 50-centimeter-long body looks more primitive. The animal's appearance is "contrary to what we expected," says paleonto$$$and co-author David Unwin of the University of Leicester in the U.K. The fossil of the predatory airborne creature, which Unwin and Chinese researchers describe online today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, supports a concept called modular evolution. It states that di$$$parts of an animal can evolve at different rates--with some structures evolving particularly rapidly. Modular evolution could explain the hybrid nature of Darwinopterus. The skull might have been much more advanced than the rest of the body because its evolution accelerated, whereas the rest of the $$$idled. Rather than small changes accumulating over a long period of time in various parts of the body, Unwin says, natural selection acted on the entire module. Modern humans are a lot alike--at least at the genetic level--compared with other primates.

Now, evolutionary geneticists have shown that our ancestors lost much of their genetic diversity in two dramatic bottlenecks that sharply squeezed down the$$$population of modern humans as they moved out of Africa between 60,000 and 50,000 years ago.

And just like T. $$$Raptorex's forelimbs were puny.

Based on a trait-by-$$$comparison, Sereno said, Raptorex belongs to an early side branch of the evolutionary group that gave rise to T. rex about 60 million years later.

They then scanned the mutant fish for unusual traits. One mutant was almost s$$$reminiscent of domesticated mirror carp bred to lack many scales to be easy to clean. The researchers tracked the mutation down to a gene called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgfr1). Because mutations in this gene typically cause mammal and fish embryos to die, Harris and Rohner suspected it $$$have a twin somewhere else in the zebrafish genome. It did. The researchers found an intact version of fgfr1, in addition to the mutated copy that leads to mirror scales. To see if the process of duplication and mutation happens outside the lab, Harris and Rohner scanned for fgfr1 in mirror carp. Th$$$found duplicate fgfr1 genes in two varieties of mirror carp: One had lost 111 bases from the twin gene, and another had a base substitution in the twin gene, both of which had presumably led to fewer scales.

That's where $$$largest number of similar groupings of DNA, called haplogroups, is found. As the researchers looked at dogs farther from this region, they saw fewer haplogroups; Europe had only four, for example. "The gene pool we are finding in Europe and Africa are a subset of the South Chinese gene pool," says S$$$Savolainen's critics have noted that low diversity in European dogs might be the result of intense selective breeding, and thus it may not reflect the ancient diversity of dogs there. But the European dogs all lack the same six haplogroups, regardless of breed, indicating that the lower diversity pr$$$the development of purebred strains, Savolainen says.

He points out $$$other genetic studies suggest dogs date back at least 20,000 years and that archaeological remains of dogs in Europe are almost as old. He also worries about bias that might have arisen in Savolainen's study if the dogs were not sampled the same way in all locations.

Improved DNA sequencing technology is making reading genomes faster and cheaper every day. But modifying genes in microbes and other organisms still requires slow and painstaking e$$$Now, researchers report that they've come up with a new way to modify the genomes of billions of microbes simultaneously and then finger the ones with the most interesting changes.

But in many cases, scientists would like to better direct these mutations to specific regions of the ge$$$and make changes to several sites at the same time. To do so, researchers led by synthetic biologist George Church of Harvard University came up with a new, high-speed technique called multiplexed automated genome engineering for targeting mutations. The researchers started by introducing three gene$$$into an Escherichia coli bacterium that allowed it to make an antioxidant known as lycopene. They then identified 24 regions in the E. coli genome where they suspected that changes could improve the microbes' lycopene output. The researchers synthesized snippets of single stranded DNA known as oligo$$$each of which carried a unique mutation. They tailored each oligo to bind to one of the 24 target regions. Finally, the team subjected the target cells to a strong electric field. That temporarily poked holes in the cell membranes, allowing the oligos to diffuse inside and slip into the bacterial DN$$$The researchers report online this week in Nature that in just 3 days, they generated some 14.2 billion different mutations at the 24 sites. That led to an E. coli that produced five times more lycopene than did the original microbe. In the end, the researchers sequenced the genomes of the best lyco$$$producers to identify the exact mutations that boosted the output. "The concept is nice," says James Liao, a bioengineer at the University of California, Los Angeles. He says that because the technique rapidly speeds and targets evolution, he anticipates using it in his own lab to find microbes that$$$are more efficient at producing biofuels. However, Liao suspects the uses won't stop there. "It's a general method. It's up to the users to find the applications." Desperate to have a baby girl? It helps to be poor. That's the conclusion of a study in Rwanda, which shows that, when men marry multipl$$$women, low-ranking wives are more likely to have daughters than sons. The findings indicate that the social ranking of human mothers can influence the sex of their offspring. In 1973, evolutionary biologists Robert Trivers and Dan Willard predicted that in many species, social and environmental fact$$$may influence whether a female has more sons or daughters. For instance, in a polygynous species, where males mate with more than one female, males in good condition are at a reproductive advantage over less-fit males because they have more mating partners. According to the Trivers-Willard hypothesi$$$well-off females in these societies are better off having sons, because sons will have more chances to pass on their parents' genes. However, if moms in polygynous unions don't have many resources to invest, they're better off producing daughters, because only affluent males have multiple wives; dau$$$will be mated with regardless of status. Over the years, several studies have supported the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, including work in red deer, mice, and a variety of nonhuman primates. And in humans, studies of Hungarian Roma and mothers in rural Ethiopia have shown evidence of a Trivers-Willar$$$pattern, but others looking into modern Venezuelan society and the Sudanese Bari ethnic group haven't returned the same results. Thomas Pollet, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, thinks the confusion is partly a result of researchers struggling to determi$$$what constitutes better or worse conditions for mothers. So Pollet and his colleagues looked at a novel maternal situation: the ranking of wives in polygynous Rwandan societies, within which the links between social standing, resource availability, and offspring are easy to tease out. The team exami$$$census data for 843,000 women in 12 regions in Rwanda and compared the sex ratio of offspring among three groups of women: those in monogamous unions, the first or second wives in polygynous unions, and third wives. The researchers found that, in addition to having fewer children in general, the thi$$$wives were 9% to 12% more likely than higher-ranking wives to have surviving infant daughters than sons. The monogamous, first and second wives had more sons than daughters. Pollet and colleagues believe these results fit with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. One possible explanation, the authors rep$$$today in Biology Letters, is that women in dominant positions, such as first or only wives, have higher levels of testosterone, making them more likely to have sons. Lena Edlund, an economist at Columbia University who has previously studied how the Trivers-Willard hypothesis fits with social status$$$says Pollet's methods are sound and that wife rank seems to be a good measure of women's status. One possible mechanism not mentioned in the study, she says, is that lower-ranked wives might suffer nutritionally, which has been shown to influence a child's sex. Low glucose levels, she says, could le$$$to more daughters, for example. Time for a pop quiz. Which mammal evolves more rapidly: the ringtail, a raccoonlike animal common in the southwestern United States, or the closely related cacomistle, which lives in tropical forests in southern Mexico and Central America? The answer is the cacomistle$$$according to a surprising new study indicating that lower elevations and lower latitudes seem to speed up microevolution in mammals. For years, many scientists would have considered that to be a trick question. Previous studies showed that plants living at low latitudes and elevations did evolve mor$$$quickly, most likely because the warmer temperatures boosted their metabolic rate, which in turn increased their mutation rate. But most researchers believed that mammals wouldn't respond in the same way because warm-blooded creatures maintain a fairly constant body temperature no matter the outside$$$temperature, so any connection between climate and metabolism would be moot. But the pattern of mammal biodiversity--extensive in low elevations and nearer the equator, sparse in high places and nearer the poles--suggested a connection to Len Gillman, an evolutionary ecologist at the Auckland Univer$$$of Technology in New Zealand. "I thought, 'There's got to be a universal explanation. So Gillman and his colleagues spent the next year and a half analyzing 130 closely related species pairs, such as the ringtail and cacomistle, in which one species lives at a lower latitude or elevation than its si$$$species.

The more mutations in the gene, the faster that species has evolv$$$since it split from the common ancestor. Gillman and colleagues report today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B that species living at lower elevations and lower latitudes seem to have evolved on average about 1.5 times more quickly than their sister species. The team has two possible explana$$$for this pattern. First, animals in colder climates are less active, often resting or hibernating to conserve energy. Some studies suggest a link between activity and annual average metabolic rate, which could mean fewer mutations in languid species. The second explanation derives from the Red Queen$$$Hypothesis, which posits an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey. Gillman says that if plants in warmer climates evolve more quickly, mammals living there will also have to speed up their evolution to keep pace with their food's rapidly adapting defenses. Jason Weir, an evolutionary eco$$$at the University of Chicago in Illinois whose past work has found no connection between latitude and rate of evolution in birds, says that Gillman's study is interesting but overlooks an important factor: generation time. Because the tropics favor breeding almost all year long, animals living there$$$produce subsequent generations more quickly. Mammals in colder areas, in contrast, breed less often. "A large generation time is often believed to result in slower mutation rates," Weir explains. Marcel Cardillo, an evolutionary ecologist at the Australian National University in Canberra whose previ$$$work also came to different conclusions than Gillman's, shares Weir's concerns about generation time. But he says that Gillman's methods are sound and the results are "potentially another important piece in the puzzle of why there are more species in the tropics." A cosmologist has created a mathema$$$model that he says shows space-time, contrary to common wisdom, did not begin with the Big Bang. Instead, the model suggests a universe pretty much like the one we live in today existed before the event, except it was contracting instead of expanding. If ever proven, the idea could force a complete $$$of the origins of the cosmos and perhaps even open a doorway to an endless future. The Big Bang--the sudden and extremely rapid expansion of space-time that began 13.7 billion years ago--is generally accepted among scientists as the beginning of the universe. However, they have long puzzled over a p$$$that the event caused in the mathematical calculations of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. At the moment of the Big Bang, everything was thought to be crammed into a singularity--a space with no dimensions--that also contained infinite density. Einstein couldn't explain how such a state coul$$$give rise to a universe of finite density and possibly finite dimensions. Theoretical physicist Sean Carroll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena put it more succinctly: "Everyone's calculations show the universe started from a singularity," he says, "but no one believes it." Most c$$$have come to think that quantum mechanics--something unknown during Einstein's time--could hold the key to this conundrum. According to quantum mechanics, random activity on an extremely tiny scale can affect the outcome of events vast distances away and involving gigantic masses. For example, adher$$$of this theory believe that the current universe turned out so lumpy--with clusters of galaxies in some areas and nearly empty space in others--because of quantum fluctuations at the moment of the Big Bang. But so far quantum mechanics has not been able to explain where the universe came from in the$$$first place. Although most cosmologists think it sprang forth from nothingness along with the forces of nature, theoretical physicist Martin Bojowald of Pennsylvania State University in University Park thinks his mathematical model points to something even stranger: The cosmos is a leftover from a p$$$manifestation of existence. Bojowald's model is based on a new and developing line of theoretical reasoning called Loop Quantum Gravity, which attempts to reconcile Einstein's theory with quantum mechanics. As Bojowald reported online in the 1 July Nature Physics, the model shows that at the moment $$$the Big Bang, the current universe had a minimum volume that was not zero and carried a huge but finite amount of energy. Furthermore, the calculations strongly suggest that the current universe actually received a kick–start from the dying epoch of a previous, contracting universe. They do so by sh$$$that the previous universe could not have compacted itself into a singularity, as general relativity predicts, because at extremes of temperature and pressure, gravity becomes repulsive instead of attractive. As a result, gravitational energy grew so large as the previous universe contracted that it$$$created a "Big Bounce," as Bojowald calls it, which ignited the current expansion. With some luck, he says, it might be possible to find clues about what the previous universe was like from more detailed observations and models of quantum mechanics. Far-fetched or not, Carroll thinks Bojowald's mode$$$represents a "good thing to be doing," because somehow cosmologists are going to have to resolve the singularity dilemma, and although his conclusions might not provide the correct answer, it's "not premature to be asking the questions." A long time ago, in a universe much larger than our own, a gia$$$star collapsed. Its implosion crammed so much mass and energy together that it created a wormhole to another universe. And inside this wormhole, our own universe was born. It may seem fantastic, but a theoretical physicist claims that such a scenario could help answer some of the most perplexing que$$$in cosmology. A number of facets about our universe don't make sense. One is gravity. Scientists can't construct a mathematical formula that unites gravity with the three other basic forces of nature: the strong and weak nuclear forces and electromagnetism. Another problem is dark energy, the myster$$$phenomenon that seems to be expanding our universe at an accelerating rate, even though gravity should be contracting it or at least slowing the expansion. These conundrums may be a result of stopping the search for the riddle of the cosmos at the big bang, says Nikodem Poplawski of Indiana Universi$$$in Bloomington. The big bang theory holds that our universe began as a single point—or singularity—about 13.7 billion years ago that has been expanding outward ever since. Perhaps, Poplawski argues, we need to consider that something existed before the big bang that gave rise to it. Enter the wormho$$$According to Poplawski's calculations, the collapse of a giant star in another universe could have created a wormhole, a space-time conduit to another universe. Between these two openings, conditions could have developed that were similar to those we associate with the big bang, and therefore our un$$$could have formed within the wormhole. Such a scenario could address the quandaries about gravity and the expanding universe. If another universe existed before our own, gravity could be traced back to a point where it did unite with the nuclear forces and electromagnetism. And if our universe is no$$$expanding toward the other end of the wormhole, this movement—rather than the elusive dark energy—could account for our expanding universe.The calculations need further refinement, admits Poplawski, who will publish his findings on Monday in Physics Letters B.

"You will be stuck," he says. Cosmologist Martin Bojowald of Pennsylvania State University, University Park, won't even go that far. He thinks the way the paper treats the gravitational collapse into a wormhole is a bit "contrived." It would be difficult to imagine the idea has applica$$$"beyond pure theory," he says. Nevertheless, theorist Eduardo Guendelman of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, Israel, finds the paper's way of describing the junction of two universes "very instructive." The key question, Guendelman says, is whether the matter necessary to construct t$$$wormhole exists. reactors, and oil. In terms of potential, wind-energy resources are tremendous. One estimate puts it at nearly five times as much as the world's entire existing electricity demand. And for environmentalists and anticarbon advocates, wind offers an energy source that does not require$$$drilling, mining, or enriched uranium—and its carbon footprint is essentially zero. But wind is erratic. A region might get gale-force winds one day and dead calm the next. To balance things out, engineers have proposed linking up wind farms to take advantage of wind variability across a wider area.$$$But until now, no one had ever quantified whether meteorological conditions would justify such a linkup. In the new study, energy policy analyst and electrical engineer Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware, Newark, and colleagues did just that. "Instead of just looking at the statistics of $$$turbines," he says, "we also decided to look at the meteorology." First the researchers chose a region known for its relatively constant winds. They compiled 5 years of wind data from 11 offshore weather-monitoring stations buoyed along 2500 kilometers of the East Coast. They estimated how much powe$$$offshore wind farms could produce if they had been placed at the same locations as the monitoring stations—which would be the case under current wind-farm configurations. Then they calculated the combined power output of the farms if they were all connected into a single grid. As the team reports on$$$today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, at no time during the 5-year span of the study did the winds die down completely along the hypothetical grid. That means it would have been possible for the hypothetical offshore wind-power grid to generate electricity continuously for al$$$of that time. Moreover, Kempton explains, linking the wind farms showed "a tremendous amount of smoothing" of power output. Farms located, say, in the Northeast might be operating at full tilt under gale-force winds, while the southeastern portion of the grid languishes under sunny skies and tepid b$$$As the wind data showed, he added, the quick swings between high- and low-power generation periods that are characteristic of individual wind farms slowed down dramatically within the simulated grid, taking days instead of hours or even minutes. By creating a wind-power grid, he says, "you can make $$$rapidly changing and unsteady source of power a slowly changing and stable one." This is the first time a study has demonstrated that offshore East Coast wind energy can provide "a relatively reliable supply of smooth power," says environmental engineer Mark Jacobson of Stanford University in Califo$$$The findings are "important," he says, because the wind resources of the region are "tremendous and could theoretically supply all U.S. electric power demand." The findings are "amazing," agrees Cristina Archer, a specialist in wind energy meteorology at California State University, Chico. Kempton's$$$team shows "that an uninterrupted power supply from winds along the most populated and most energy-demanding coastal area in the country, and perhaps in the world, is possible." The seas may be rising due to climate change, but most of the seafloor is also dropping as part of the natural dynamics of$$$Earth's crust. The question that has dogged scientists for decades, however, is why hasn't the ocean bottom sunk faster? An exhaustive analysis of the Pacific Ocean seabed may provide at least part of the answer—though experts think important questions remain. Earth's crust is like an ice field floa$$$atop the ocean. As tectonic plates move away from each other, the underlying mantle wells up between them. This process builds underwater mountain ranges, such as the central ridges of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The mantle also heats the plates near this upwelling, making them more buoyant—and$$$thus raising the seafloor. As the new crust cools, it sinks under its own weight—a process called subsidence—so the seafloor should be deeper the farther it is from a mid-ocean ridge. But that's not what scientists have found. In the oldest parts of the seafloor, which are also the parts farthest aw$$$from the mid-ocean ridges, the ocean bottom tends to be considerably shallower than expected—in some cases hundreds of meters shallower. What has been holding it up? Geoscientists Claudia Adam of the University of Évora in Portugal and Valérie Vidal of the University of Lyon in France, argue that th$$$answer can be found in the behavior of the mantle. They reviewed measurements and topography of the seafloor at nearly 800 locations across the entire Pacific. That's the largest stretch of ocean bottom on the planet, and the direction and rate of motion of the twin Pacific plates has remained reaso$$$constant for about 50 million years. The researchers compared those measurements with depths predicted by models and then analyzed the results using a new hypothesis about the flow of heat within the mantle. In tomorrow's issue of Science, the duo reports that the discrepancies between the real dept$$$of the sea bottom and the depths predicted by standard models can be accounted for by spreading out the heat from the mantle farther away from the mid-ocean ridges. That extra thermal energy gives the ocean plates more buoyancy as they move farther away from the ridges. Adam and Vidal found that if $$$applied this hypothesis to their models, the results closely coincided with their observations—enough to account for the shallower sea bottom. It's an "intriguing" conclusion, says geoscientist Kevin Furlong of Pennsylvania State University, University Park. But the problem, as he sees it, is that t$$$researchers "as yet have not provided the physical mechanism" to explain how the convection of heat proceeds through the mantle. On the other hand, geophysicist Dave Stegman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, calls the results of the paper "exciting and profound." I$$$confirmed, he says, the findings mean that we now understand "a very fundamental aspect of tectonics and the evolution of the Earth." The findings might even explain the puzzling curve in the migration of the Hawaiian Islands chain over millions of years, he says, because their motion might have bee$$$governed by mantle processes instead of tectonics. Geophysicist Seth Stein of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, predicts that the new model will catch on if it can reliably explain certain aspects of seafloor dynamics, such as whether the seafloor flattens in the Atlantic and Indian oce$$$in the same way as it does in the Pacific. Otherwise, he says, the standard models will probably persist because "they still do a reasonable job in predicting ocean depth, including the flattening." A protein's shape determines its function, so this molecular geometry is of extreme interest to scien$$$and drug companies. But it's no easy task to deduce a protein's atomic structure. Now a team has found a way to double the size of a protein that a common technique, called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), can decipher. For researchers looking to solve protein structures, the most popular technique$$$remains x-ray crystallography, which bombards crystals of a protein with high-intensity x-rays to reveal their atomic arrangement. Nevertheless, NMR still has two big advantages: It works on proteins that don't crystallize, and it can reveal a protein's dynamic nature rather than give a mere static $$$In a nutshell, NMR works as follows: A solution of a molecule is exposed to a magnetic field. The atomic nuclei (especially hydrogen nuclei) behave like gyroscopes. The precise rate at which a nucleus turns depends on the exact magnetic field at its position, which in turn depends on the relative po$$$and chemical identities of its neighbors. So from the myriad wobblings, researchers can in principle work out the relative locations of all the nuclei. Given the complexity of analysis, however, NMR has worked best for smaller proteins. NMR researchers typically collect three kinds of experimental d$$$an easily acquired set, known as chemical shifts, which depends on what kind of atom the nearest neighbor is; a second set known as residual dipolar coupling (RDC), which is influenced by the orientation of various chemical bonds, and a third method called the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), which $$$to interpret some of the chemical shift data. Interpreting all these data is quite involved. In 2008, David Baker, a biochemist and protein modeling expert at the University of Washington, Seattle, made a breakthrough in simplifying the task. He and his colleagues did away with the need for the NOE $$$RDC data by combing chemical shift data into their protein-modeling software called ROSETTA. That allowed them to consistently determine the correct shape of moderate-sized proteins--containing up to 100 amino acids--a feat that had been accomplished only in a hit-or-miss way with early protein-mode$$$software. For their current study, Baker and colleagues wanted to see if they could extend their hybrid approach to even larger proteins. To do so, they added back a small amount of the NOE and RDC data, but just in the parts of the analysis that deduce the shape of the general backbone of the prote$$$rather then the position of all the individual atoms in each amino acid side chain. They then relied on their ROSETTA software to sort out the position of the atoms in the protein's side chains. The team reports online in Science Express that their latest hybrid succeeded in working out the structur$$$of proteins up to 200 amino acids long. “It's a very important development and shows where we are likely to be going as a field,” says Ad Bax, an NMR expert at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. Proteins of that size have been solved by NMR be$$$but only with an amount of time and effort beyond most NMR teams. It's also a size of many biologically important proteins, such as proteins wedged into cell membranes, which are difficult to crystallize. So Bax notes that as the new hybrid approach matures, it may prove useful in mapping some of th$$$vital proteins for the first time. It's a mystery that stumped even Charles Darwin. How did a reddish, stocky wolf arrive on the Falkland Islands? This small archipelago nearly 500 kilometers off the coast of Argentina has no other endemic terrestrial mammals, not even rodents. Any hope of an answer$$$seemed to die with the last Fands Island Wolf, shot by a hunter in 1876. But now a research team has used DNA from museum specimens, including one that Darwin collected, to solve the puzzle. The coyote-sized Falklands Island Wolf (Dusicyon australis) was strikingly different from smaller canids on t$$$South American mainland, Darwin noted during his 1837 voyage on the Beagle. Since then, biologists have argued about whether the wolves were actually foxes (which is what Darwin called them) or, like the Australian dingo, descended from dogs that people had brought to the islands (Science, 30 Septem$$$1977, p. 1340). To determine the wolf's ancestral lineage, Graham Slater, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues compared DNA sequences from five museum specimens with those of living South American canids, including a group of foxlike animals that had$$$been previously suggested as their most likely relatives. The team found that the Falklands wolves proved most similar to the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), which hails from the South American savannas. "That was a big surprise," says Slater, because of the pronounced difference between the two$$$creatures. The maned wolf has much longer legs than the Falklands wolf and long jaws suited for catching rats and mice; the island wolf has shorter, Labrador retriever-like jaws designed for grabbing and shaking large prey, such as seals and penguins. The study, published online tomorrow in Current $$$points to a North American origin for all South American canids. The Falklands Island Wolf and the maned wolf diverged 6.7 million years ago, probably in North America given that the oldest fossils of canids in South America date back 2.5 million years, says Slater. The findings rule out the idea th$$$people played any role in the wolves' arrival on the islands. Instead, an analysis of the museum specimens' mitochondrial DNA shows that they shared a last common ancestor at least 70,000 years ago, suggesting that they reached the Falklands prior to the end of the last ice age; humans only set foot$$$in the New World about 20,000 years ago. Because the islands were never connected to the mainland, the Falklands wolf must have crossed the sea from South America by clinging to logs or an ice floe, the researchers conclude. "Their incredible journey shows the extraordinary adaptability and tenacity$$$of canids," says David Macdonald, a conservation zoologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. "It is a riveting paper and a fitting birthday present to Darwin," says Macdonald, because "the weirdly leggy maned wolf" that became the "somewhat doggy Falklands Island Wolf" shows how mut$$$species can be.

There are limits to just how magnetic a material can be. Or so researchers thought. A compound of iron and nitrogen is about 18% more magnetic than the most magnet$$$material currently known, a team of materials scientists claims. If such magnets could be produced commercially, they could, for example, allow electronics manufacturers to equip computer hard drives with smaller "write heads" capable of being crammed with more information. Other researchers are rea$$$to the announcement with caution, however, as similar claims about the controversial material have fallen through in the past. A material's magnetism originates with its spinning electrons. Each electron acts like a little magnet with its field aligned with the axis of its spin, and when more electr$$$spin in one direction than in the opposite direction, the material becomes magnetic. For example, an iron atom has four more electrons spinning one way than the other. In a bulk material, the situation is more complicated, as the electron clouds of individual atoms merge into riverlike bands. Electr$$$spinning "up" flow in different bands from those spinning "down," and the difference between the numbers of highest-energy electrons in the up bands and the down bands determines the material's magnetism—which is smaller than one might expect from the magnetism of a single atom. Using such band theo$$$researchers can predict which material should have the largest magnetism: iron cobalt. However, Jian-Ping Wang, a materials physicist at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and colleagues say that a compound of eight parts iron and one part nitrogen, Fe16N2, exceeds this limit by roughly 18%. $$$key to the material's extremely high magnetism lies in its complicated crystal structure, Wang reported here yesterday at the March Meeting of the American Physical Society. Probing their samples with x-ray, the researchers determined that within them, each nitrogen atom sits in the center of a clus$$$of six iron atoms and that a couple more iron atoms sit between neighboring clusters. The electrons flowing between the clusters act much like electrons in ordinary iron. But the electrons in the iron atoms in the clusters tend to get stuck, or "localized," where they are. As a result, Wang says, th$$$atoms contribute more like individual atoms to the overall magnetism, driving it way up. "If it's right, it's super important," says Eric Fullerton, a physicist at the University of California, San Diego. But he stresses the "if." As Wang himself explained, as early as 1972, others had claimed that $$$is extraordinarily magnetic. In the 1990s, researchers with the Japanese high-tech company Hitachi reported observations that seemed to bolster those claims. However, the evidence was problematic in several ways, Fullerton says. For example, some of the results depended on tricky estimations of exac$$$what fraction a sample's volume consisted of Fe16N2, which is metastable and tends to fall apart into other crystal structures. Others have not been able to reproduce the Hitachi results, Fullerton says. Wang, however, says his team has been honing its techniques for years and can now reliably grow $$$of Fe16N2. The researchers have also measured the magnetization with a technique called x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, which compares the material's ability to absorb x-ray light whose polarization twirls to the right or to the left. That measure is less sensitive to volume effects than earlier $$$and directly detects the localized electrons, Wang says. The team has also cranked out detailed "first principles" simulations that show the emergence of the localized electrons and make the whole scenario hang together, Wang says.

Why, for example, do flocks suddenly change directions and then change directions again within a few seconds? Why do birds in flight suddenly stop to rest on a certain stretch of telephone wire? And lacking any threat or sudden disturbance,$$$why do flocks on the ground spontaneously take to the air? To find some of the answers, researchers exploited a bit of 21st century technology. A team lead by statistical physicist Tamás Vicsek of Eötvös University in Hungary outfitted a trained flock of 13 homing pigeons with tiny GPS receivers tha$$$could determine each individual bird's position every 0.2 seconds. Then they sent as many as 10 members of the flock out on 15 test flights. The journeys included four flights of about 15 kilometers back to the birds' roost and 11 flights roaming freely around their home base outside Budapest. The r$$$tracked each bird's directional changes and how often those changes either followed or were copied by its flockmates. In today's issue of Nature, the team reports that the flight patterns showed a definite hierarchy, with most or all of the birds consistently copying changes in direction by the floc$$$leaders, which almost always flew in front. If, for example, a leading bird suddenly swerved to the right, its followers copied its move within about 0.4 seconds—an amount of time considered too long to be reflexive. However, the data also revealed that the leaders weren't always the same, even with$$$a single flight. And sometimes, even the birds at the bottom of the pecking order would lead the flock for brief periods. The arrangement made each flight more egalitarian, but the researchers think the reason might be more evolutionarily than politically driven. It's possible that this type of grou$$$decision-making is more accurate or beneficial than others, says zoologist and co-author Dora Biro of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Perhaps the individuals in the flocks stand a better chance of survival if they sometimes participate in guiding the group rather than constantly subm$$$to a single leader, she says. Another curiosity was that the lower-ranking birds most often flew behind and to the right of the leaders. The researchers think this relates to the structure of the birds' brains, in which the left side handles spatial tasks and the right side governs social recognitio$$$Therefore, anything the birds see with their left eye (which is processed by the right side of the brain) tends to yield a quicker social response. "The degree of coordination that flocks achieve is really impressive," Biro says. "We identified a clear hierarchical structure within the decision-maki$$$process." She says the team next plans to study flock members in greater depth, including their genders, ages, navigational experiences, to determine "what airborne leaders are made of." The findings could help explain group behavior of other animals, such as schooling fish, says evolutionary biolog$$$Iain Couzin of Princeton University. There's a "fascinating balance" between democratic and hierarchical control in the pigeon flocks, he says. And this sophisticated study reveals the link between the birds' brain hemispheres and how they gather information during their flights. It achieves "a deep$$$understanding of coordinated control in animal groups," he says. It isn't exactly payback for taking out the dinosaurs, but Earth's gravity seems to disrupt the surfaces of asteroids that pass close by, researchers have found. The findings should improve our understanding of the composition of these$$$tiny planetary bodies and might help scientists find ways to fend off asteroids that could strike Earth. For many years, the popular conception of asteroids--the thousands of planetary fragments that cloud the inner solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter--was that they consisted of soli$$$rock or metal. Astronomers explained their potatolike shapes as the result of frequent collisions with their neighbors. But more-recent observations have shown that asteroids actually resemble piles of gravel held together very weakly by gravity. So weakly in fact that they sometimes temporarily spl$$$in two, recongealing after thousands of years. Now, research suggests that near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)--those whose paths take them near or across Earth's orbit--are so fragile that their surfaces roil anytime they encounter our planet's gravity. The idea arose because of a curious observation. Most$$$asteroids show a slight reddish cast caused by the constant bombardment of solar-wind particles, a process called space weathering. Yet the surfaces of nearly half of all NEAs appear fresh, as scientists term it, with no effects of space weathering. One possible reason for the fresh surfaces, a team$$$reports tomorrow in Nature, is that those asteroids had their surfaces disturbed by past close gravitational encounters with Earth. So the researchers retraced the orbit of every known NEA that didn't exhibit space weathering. "Each and every fresh asteroid, when we traced it backward for 500,000 ye$$$had passed very close to Earth"--within 100,000 kilometers, versus millions of kilometers for the other NEAs-- says planetary scientist and co-author Richard Binzel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. What seems to happen, Binzel explains, is that even a gentle gravitational p$$$from a planetary encounter is enough to churn the asteroid's weathered surface. "It's kind of like if you could shake [up] a dirty snowbank," he says. "The result would be a lot of fresh snow ending up back on top and making the surface fresh and bright again." Binzel says that he and colleagues are$$$looking forward to an encounter with Apophis in 2029. That's when the 270-meter-wide asteroid is expected to pass within 35,000 kilometers of Earth--closer than the orbit of some telecommunications satellites. The flyby "should be a very interesting case," he says. Space agencies might be able to pl$$$instruments on the asteroid's surface that could "tell us how potentially hazardous asteroids like Apophis are put together," he says. "And learning how they are put together would help us to figure out how to deflect these objects, in the event one was ever found to be on a collision course with Ea$$$Space scientist William Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, says the findings reveal much about the physical evolution of asteroids.

The push to ramp up biofuel production may reduce oil imports, but it's likely to come at a high environmental cost: It will bo$$$the size of the Gulf of Mexico's dead zone, a huge swath so depleted of oxygen that almost nothing can live there, according to a new analysis. The gulf's dead zone is already a major environmental problem. First spotted in 1971, it now spans 14,600 square kilometers, or 1,460,000 hectares, a region$$$larger than Connecticut. It is triggered every spring and summer when nutrient-rich water flows from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers into the Gulf of Mexico. The nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, come primarily from fertilizer washed off of farms throughout the Midwest. They trigg$$$blooms of algae that then die and are eaten by bacteria. The bacteria use up most of the water's dissolved oxygen, killing fish, shrimp, crabs, and other organisms. The U.S. federal government and agencies from several states in the Mississippi River Basin have established efforts to reduce nutrient$$$flows into the Gulf of Mexico in hopes of limiting the size of the dead zone to 500,000 hectares, about one-third of its current size. But in 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) that aims to reduce oil imports by backing the production of 36 billion gallons of biofu$$$by 2022. Of that, 15 billion gallons is slated to come from corn ethanol and the rest from cellulosic ethanol and other "advanced biofuels" that require less energy and fertilizer inputs. Last year, researchers reported that if 15 billion gallons or more of biofuels per year came from corn ethanol, $$$result would be a large spike in nutrients hitting the Gulf of Mexico. For the current study, Michael Griffin, a microbiologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and colleagues asked how the gulf would fare if more fuels came from cellulosic feedstocks, which typically requi$$$only about one-fourth of the fertilizer that corn does. They found that even if all the biofuels came from cellulosics, the amount of nitrates in the water would be only about 20% lower than if 15 billion gallons came from corn ethanol. But in both scenarios, the nitrogen emissions into the gulf wou$$$be higher than today's levels, and thus would be expected to increase the size of the gulf's dead zone. The new work, reported in the 1 October issue of Environmental Science & Technology, underscores just how difficult it will be to reverse the growing dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, says Simon Do$$$a climate scientist and ecologist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, in Canada: "Something that was already difficult, the biofuels mandate will make practically impossible." The Aztecs, who ruled central Mexico for several hundred years before the Spanish arrived in 1519, left the mo$$$extensive mathematical writings of any pre-Columbian people. Two manuscripts in particular have intrigued scholars because they portray land holdings in the Valley of Mexico along with their measurements, using the Aztec numbering system, for purposes of taxation. Now a geographer and a mathematicia$$$have zeroed in on just what methods Aztec surveyors used to measure the surface of a field in one of these documents, the Codex Vergara. Scientists long ago deciphered the Aztec number system, a vigesimal system (using 20 as its base) as opposed to our decimal system. In Aztec arithmetic, a dot equa$$$1, a bar represents 5, and there are other symbols for 20 and various multiples thereof. The Codex Vergara, painted about 1540, contains schematic drawings and measurements of individual fields. Previous research on it has revealed an understanding of multiplication and division as well as certain p$$$of geometry. Now, Barbara Williams of the University of Wisconsin-Rock County in Janesville, with Maria del Carmen Jorge y Jorge of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, has analyzed the Codex Vergara to discover just how Aztec surveyors estimated land area in parcels that were often irregul$$$shaped. The analysis reveals a "very practical kind of arithmetic and record keeping," says Michael Smith, an archaeologist at Arizona State University, Tempe. In a paper published in tomorrow's issue of Science (4 April, p. 72) the authors show that Aztec surveyors probably used several types of al$$$to calculate area. Some parcels involved simply multiplying length by width. But in other, irregular four-sided lots, they had to come up with different approaches, such as multiplying the average of two opposite sides by an adjacent side. Furthermore, when a measurement did not match a precise numb$$$of "land rods"--their standard unit of linear measurement, which corresponded to about 2.5 meters--the Aztecs added symbols, such as an arrow, a heart, a hand, or a bone, to indicate remaining length that was less than one rod. Working back from the recorded land areas, the authors determined that t$$$corresponded to different fractions of a land rod. Although the Aztecs are the only early Americans to have left these kinds of technical documents, it's reasonable to assume that other groups such as the numerically sophisticated Maya used similar systems, Smith says. "There's a view that ancient p$$$were obsessed with religion and that science and knowledge were all directed at religious ends," he adds. But the paper shows that the Aztecs apparently liked to get their measurements right--and certainly when it came to taxation. Boys with the longest ring fingers relative to their index fingers t$$$to excel in math, according to a new study. In girls, shorter ring fingers predict better verbal skills. The link, according to the researchers, is that testosterone levels in the womb influence both finger length and brain development. Scientists have been interested for years in the observation th$$$ratios of finger lengths differ in men and women. In men, the ring (fourth) finger is usually longer than the index (second); their so-called 2D:4D ratio is lower than 1. In females, the two fingers are more likely to be the same length. Because of this sex difference, some scientists believe that a$$$low ratio could be a marker for higher prenatal testosterone levels, although it's not clear how the hormone might influence finger development. The 2D:4D ratio has also been fingered in connection with brain-related characteristics--most often in males--such as depression, left-handedness, musical $$$and homosexuality. In the latest such study, psychologist Mark Brosnan and colleagues at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom photocopied the hands of 74 boys and girls aged 6 and 7. They compared the measurements of the second and fourth fingers with the children's scores on a standard U.K.$$$test of math and literacy. In boys, the lower the ratio, the better their math scores, the team reports in the May issue of the British Journal of Psychology. The boys with the lowest ratios also were the ones whose abilities were most skewed in the direction of math rather than literacy. These diff$$$are small but significant, says Brosnan. With the girls, there was no correlation between finger ratio and numeracy, but those with higher ratios--presumably indicating low testosterone levels--had better scores on verbal abilities. These sex-specific correlations show how tricky it is to define the$$$roles of sex hormones, says psychologist S. Marc Breedlove of Michigan State University in East Lansing. The range of normal levels of the hormone is different in males and females, so comparable levels would have very different meanings depending on the sex of the individual. And the timing of horm$$$surges is as important as the levels. Nonetheless, Brosnan believes finger measurements might be useful not only for gauging the relative contributions of male and female hormones in the womb but also for predicting cognitive abilities--although he acknowledges that "we are not suggesting that finge$$$length measurements could replace SAT tests." Others are more cautious, pointing out that scientists still have not confirmed that finger ratio is a reliable marker for prenatal testosterone levels. Breedlove calls finger length "a very noisy, imperfect marker at best." It doesn't take much, genetic$$$to turn the buzzcut of a bloodhound into the silken mane of a bearded collie. Although dog hair seems to come in an infinite variety of lengths, thicknesses, and styles, most breeds' looks are dictated by the particular versions of just three genes in that breed's genetic makeup, according to a new $$$That so few genes are involved speaks to the power of artificial selection among dogs and to the ability of just a few genetic changes to make a big difference in appearance.Ever since researchers pinpointed a gene for short stature in purebred dogs, they have been mining canine genomic data for gen$$$underlying other traits. In the new study, Elaine Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and her colleagues sought to understand such canine curiosities as why schnauzers have bushy eyebrows and mustaches, poodles have the Shirley Temple look, and basset hou$$$are clean-cut types. The study, reported online today in Science, had three main components. First, to begin to pin down some of the genes involved, the researchers assessed genetic variation at about 50,000 spots in the genome of more than 100 dachshunds--which come in short-hair, long-hair, and wi$$$varieties--and correlated the sequence differences at those spots with the type of hair. Variations at one spot on chromosome 13 were associated with wiry hair, mustaches, and eyebrows--known as furnishings among dog fanciers. With additional study, the researchers pinpointed the gene responsible. C$$$R-spondin-2, it encodes a protein that interacts with other proteins that are important for the development of hair follicles and of hair-follicle tumors that are often seen in dogs with mustaches. With respect to hair length, the researchers confirmed that a mutation in a gene called FGF5 coincides$$$with long hair. They determined that a base change that swaps an amino acid in the FGF5 protein seems to be responsible. Looking at a larger set of dog breeds, the researchers saw that change in 91% of the long-haired dogs they evaluated, 4% of short-haired dogs, and 30% of dogs with medium length h$$$In the second part of the study, the researchers did a similar genetic analysis with 76 Portuguese water dogs, about half with curly hair and half with wavy hair. A mutation in a gene for keratin, a protein found in hair, was associated with curliness. The team had studied 903 dogs from 80 breeds to$$$pin down these mutations, and in the final part of the study, they examined these and additional dogs to see how mutations at these three genes worked together to produce various coat types. Combinations of variations in R-spondin-2, FGF5, and keratin genes explain the seven coat types that characte$$$most of the dogs sampled, which represented 108 breeds. Short-hair breeds such as basset hounds, for example, have none of the three mutations; dogs with just the R-spondin-2 change had furnishings--picture an Australian terrier--and those with that change and the change in FGF5 have furnishings and$$$long, soft coats, like bearded collies. All three mutations are found in dogs with long, curly hair and mustaches--such as the bichon Frisé. That the same genes are at work in many breeds indicates that these mutations are very old. "All the unique characteristics are something that occurred once a $$$time ago and have been preserved ever since," notes Gregory Acland, a geneticist at Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine. When breeders shuffled these genes, they created dogs with new types of coats. Ake Hedhammar of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala would now like to kno$$$how these genes exert these effects and whether they are at work in other species. That's a logical next step, says Acland: "Once you have a candidate gene in one species, it's easier to ask if it's involved in [a different] species." If you've lost a tooth to decay or injury, you may not have to re$$$on that dental bridge or implant forever. Japanese scientists have found a way to bioengineer new adult teeth. So far, the method only works in mice, but experts say it may one day take hold in humans. The Japanese group, led by cell biologist Takashi Tsuji of Tokyo University of Science in Noda, Ch$$$Prefecture, focused on tooth germs, the embryonic tissues that develop into teeth. After obtaining such germs from mouse embryos, they separated out two types of cells--epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells--and then recombined them into a new bioengineered tooth germ. (Tsuji says that he and colle$$$wanted to demonstrate that, for future human clinical applications, they could likely start with epithelial and mesenchymal cells derived from a patient's own stem cells.) The team then grew the bioengineered germs in a special culture for 5 to 7 days and transplanted them into the upper jaws of adu$$$mice in the place of an extracted molar. New teeth poked through the gums after about 36 days and reached the proper size and alignment with opposing teeth for proper chewing after 49 days, the group reports online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. All indications are tha$$$the teeth function just like the real thing. They have the roots, inner pulp, and outer enamel of normal teeth and are just as hard, the team reports. Moreover, unlike dental implants, the regenerated teeth develop the periodontal ligaments that tie normal teeth to the supporting bone and the nerve $$$that give sensitivity to chewing pressure and other stresses. "We clearly demonstrated that the bioengineered organ germ could develop into a fully functioning organ," Tsuji says. "This is a significant advancement," says Irma Thesleff, a developmental biologist at the University of Helsinki. She no$$$that the group built on previous work, "but it is the first time that it is demonstrated that starting from [just two cell types] an extracted tooth can be replaced" with a functional grown-in-place tooth. Masaki Shimono, a dental scientist at Tokyo Dental College in Chiba, says the formation of nor$$$roots is apparently a first, "though many studies succeeded in forming tooth crowns." He says further challenges include demonstrating the formation of different kinds of teeth and the proper location of cusps. Tsuji admits that although the bioengineered teeth are functional, the crown widths, cusp$$$positions, and tooth patterning were not quite normal. But he expects his group to gain control over such details with further research. They have a saying in Texas: We don't have a water problem, we have a brush problem. The idea is that when shrubs and trees invade former grazing lands, they soak $$$so much groundwater that streams slow down and water supplies to cities and towns decrease. But a new study suggests that the opposite is true: Trees and shrubs on the prairies may actually help recharge the groundwater. The findings should force a rethink of land-management techniques for much of t$$$U.S.'s former rangelands. When the cattle ranches were founded on the southern Great Plains in the latter part of the 19th century—a development immortalized in the 1948 movie Red River—a lot of formerly productive and environmentally stable grassland shifted perilously close to becoming desert. Tha$$$because the cows ate away the vegetation and compacted the soil so much that its ability to absorb water declined. Those conditions persisted through much of the 20th century. Recently, mesquite and juniper trees have spread across the degraded landscape. This development, which is part of the land'$$$recovery process, has raised new fears that the trees will leech water out of the ground, threatening water resources across areas such as the Edwards Plateau. That's the 140,000-square-kilometer area that feeds many of Texas's major rivers, such as the Nueces, Frio, Guadalupe, and Llano, as well as$$$the Edwards Aquifer—possibly the most critically important water resource for the state. But little research has tested this assumption. So hydrologists Bradford Wilcox and Yun Huang of Texas A&M University in College Station conducted field studies over 10 years and analyzed U.S. Geological Survey $$$going back to 1925 on stream flow in the Edwards Plateau area. As they report in an upcoming issue of Geophysical Research Letters, since 1950 the baseline stream flow—the amount coming from groundwater, not over the surface from rainfall—has doubled in areas where the trees have replaced the former$$$degraded grasslands. Wilcox says the trees help aerate the soil, improving its ability to soak up rain. The results were "very surprising," Wilcox says. They ran contrary to the prevailing idea, which was even supported by some research, that "when the trees move in, the water disappears." The remai$$$question, he says, is whether returning the area to lush grassland would improve the stream flows even more. The research "contradicts the notion that trees and shrubs are drying up the prairie landscape," says soil scientist Mark Seyfried of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Researc$$$Service in Boise. Seyfried says the situation is similar on the plains of the northwestern United States, where juniper trees are invading and watersheds in the rangelands seem to be improving, relative to their conditions 60 to 80 years ago. In the case of the Edwards Aquifer in Texas, he says, "wh$$$you have the actual historical stream records, that kind of closes the door for me." "Mine, all mine!" That's what the vaccinia virus seems to be saying after it invades a cell and prevents its companions from following suit. But the behavior is hardly selfish. Researchers have found that the strate$$$actually helps the virus spread, as it speeds the targeting of uninfected cells. This previously unknown mechanism may lead to new ways to combat viral infections. Vaccinia doesn't cause diseases in humans, but it has helped us fight them. Thanks to its resemblance to the smallpox virus, researchers$$$were able to use vaccinia as a vaccine for the disease, eventually leading to its eradication in the late 1970s. Since then, scientists have continued to study vaccinia as a platform to develop vaccines against other diseases. Despite all of this study, researchers have missed a curious feature of t$$$virus's biology, says virologist Geoffrey Smith of Imperial College London. While looking carefully at the areas of cell destruction induced by the viruses--called plaques--he and colleagues noticed that vaccinia spread four times faster than its replication cycle would allow. "No one seemed to have$$$done the arithmetic," Smith says. So Smith and colleagues dug a bit deeper. They discovered that vaccinia produces two proteins right after it infects a cell. The proteins work together to form a complex on the cell's surface that prevents other vaccinia virus particles from entering (a process call$$$superinfection). When other vaccinia viruses come knocking, long projections of another protein, actin, shoot out from the cell membrane, causing the virus to bounce off. "The novelty here, with vaccinia, is that it's not just preventing the virus superinfecting, but physically it's repelling the vi$$$away," says Smith, whose team reports its findings today in Science. Many other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, appear to employ a similar infection strategy, says Smith. Assuming they utilize the same protein complex as vaccinia, he says, researchers may be able to fight these infections by $$$the interaction of the two proteins. Cell biologist Michael Way of the London Research Institute agrees that other viruses may also use the vaccinia infection strategy. "I think it may be more general than people realize." Easter Island may now boast another odd claim to fame: a midlife longevity dr$$$In a new study, researchers report that an antibiotic called rapamycin--after the island's Polynesian name, Rapa Nui--enabled middle-aged mice to live up to 16% longer than their rapa-free counterparts. The discovery marks the first time a drug has been shown to lengthen life span in mammals, even w$$$administered late in life. Scientists first stumbled on rapamycin in soil samples taken from Easter Island in 1965. A bacterium found in the soil, Streptomyces hygroscopicus, secreted the stuff to fend off its bacterial and fungal rivals. Rapamycin has since been used to prevent organ rejection in t$$$patients and, most recently, as an antitumor drug. The compound works by inhibiting mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and survival. When researchers realized that calorie restriction, which is known to lengthen life spans in mice, also suppresses mTOR activity, they began to wonder if rapam$$$might boost longevity as well. Encouraged by earlier studies showing that insects and worms live longer on rapamycin, a trio of labs--the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine--decided to test $$$compound on mice. The labs had access to hundreds of mice genetically diverse enough to model human diversity, thanks to the U.S. National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program, which investigates treatments with life-extending potential. Pharmacologist Randy Strong and molecular biolog$$$Z. David Sharp, who headed the study's Texas arm, planned to feed young mice rapamycin and observe the drug's effects as they aged. But by the time the researchers formulated a feed that made the rapamycin stable and easily digestible, the mice had grown old--20 months old, or about 60 human years. $$$calorie restriction and other life-lengthening measures work best when started young, Strong and his colleagues didn't expect the experiment to work in midlife. Yet the mice lived 28% to 38% longer than the controls from that point on, the researchers report in Nature, the equivalent of 6 to 9 extra$$$years in humans. Their overall life expectancy rose 5% to 16%."We were really excited because this appears to be the first drug that slows aging even if it's started later in life," says Strong. Although he and his colleagues aren't yet sure how rapamycin lengthens life, it's thought that suppressin$$$mTOR, whatever the method, prompts the body to hunker down and wait for better times, slowing its growth processes and strengthening its defenses against cell-damaging stressors. The study comes as "a pleasant surprise," says University of Washington, Seattle, molecular biologist Matthew Kaeberlein,$$$who was among the first to propose the mTOR-longevity link. "This tells us the [mTOR] pathway affects aging in mammals ... and probably affects people as well." Don't expect antiaging drugs to hit the market anytime soon, though. Rapamycin is known to raise cholesterol levels and, as a potent immune$$$system suppressant, the compound could make its consumers more susceptible to infections. Kaeberlein hopes future studies will measure the health of rapa-enhanced mice and the effects of varying rapamycin doses, in hopes of divorcing the drug's benefits from its dangers. Americans don't have the gut$$$for sushi. At least that's the implication of a new study, which finds that Japanese people harbor enzymes in their intestinal bacteria that help them digest seaweed--enzymes that North Americans lack. What's more, Japanese may have first acquired these enzymes by eating bacteria that thrive on seaw$$$in the open ocean. Mirjam Czjzek didn't set out to compare cross-cultural eating habits. Instead, the chemist at the Station Biologique de Roscoff, on the coast of Brittany in France, was interested in what it takes to digest a piece of seaweed. Unlike in land plants, the carbohydrates that make up $$$are spangled with molecules of sulfur, so special enzymes are needed to break them down. To figure out exactly which enzymes are necessary, Czjzek and colleagues embarked on what she calls "treasure-hunting in the marine bacterial genome." The researchers focused on Zobellia galactanivorans, a marin$$$bacterium known to munch on seaweed. The hunt turned up five genes in Z. galactanivorans that seemed to code for enzymes that could break down the particular carbohydrates found in the marine algae. When the researchers transferred these genes to another bacterium forced to eat seaweed carbohydrates$$$they found that two genes were particularly active. Czjzek wondered where else these genes might be lurking. So she used a computational method known as BLAST to scan vast banks of metagenomic data—the genomes of bacteria gathered from the environment—for sequences that matched up with the two Z. ga$$$genes. That's when the surprise came. "They were all, except one, from marine bacteria," Czjzek says. "The one exception ... came from human gut samples." The bacterium in question is known as Bacteroides plebeius, and it has been found only in Japanese people. Wondering whether the enzymes were uni$$$to Japanese individuals, Czjzek's team compared the microbial genomes of 13 Japanese people with those of 18 North Americans. Five of the Japanese subjects harbored the enzyme, but among the North Americans, "we didn't find a single one," says Czjzek, whose team reports its findings tomorrow in Natu$$$Where would bacteria inside the human gut get ahold of a seaweed-digesting enzyme? Czjzek speculates that they could have grabbed it from bacteria that live on the seaweed. She notes, for example, that according to tax records dating back to the 8th century C.E., seaweed was used as a form of paymen$$$in Japanese society. "That shows the importance of this type of good," Czjzek says. With nori, the seaweed used to wrap sushi or wakame, a green seaweed often served in miso soup, being consumed day after day, the bacteria in the gut would have a chance to incorporate genetic material from their mar$$$cousins. "Traditionally, [the Japanese] eat [seaweed] raw, not sterile," says Czjzek. "This makes the contact possible." The ability to munch on a few extra carbohydrates might have given these gut bacteria a leg up over their thousands of competitors, says Czjzek. It also may help their human hosts$$$Because gut bacteria can squeeze energy from carbohydrates that human enzymes can't break down, these adapted microbes might help Japanese who dine on seaweed get more nutrition from their meal than do North Americans, she says. Scientists have thought that gut bacteria might pick up genes from othe
